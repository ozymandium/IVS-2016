\begin{abstract}

When operating an autonomous ground vehicle on roadways, it is common to employ the path-velocity decomposition (i.e., path planning is performed prior to planning the speed that the vehicle will take along the chosen path).
Given a desired path, we present a novel method of planning longitudinal trajectories (i.e., the time derivatives of position in the body-forward direction) along that path.
This method first segments the path using an arbitrary set of kinematic or dynamic constaints.
Each segement is then planned sequentially by choosing a piecewise constant jerk profile.
The jerk profile is intelligently chosen from a set of pre-solved profiles such that acceleration is continuous throughout the entire path.
The resultant trajectory plan can then be easily sampled to provide a reference for real-time vehicle control.
This method is shown to be efficient and reliable for use in online planning with a test vehicle.
