Reviewer 1 of IV'16 submission 318

Comments to the author
======================

Overall: 
The abstract is very promising. Unfortunately the content
of the abstract is not completely covered in the paper
itself: the results of 100h testing is missing in the
paper.

Section II: I understand that the reference path is input
to the system. Where is this input linked to?

--> talk about path input to path manager in beginning of section 3, reference 
figure 1
    DONE

Section III: 
- At several points you refer to section V (e.g.
explanation of s). However, since the reader did not read
this section yet, it makes it hard to follow. Maybe you
could consider to introduce 's' earlier than in section V?

--> talk about time parameterization of path earlier, table lookup
Remove the 2D/1D distinction, and just talk about lookup, and Frenet coordinate system

- Is the pedestrian behavior included in your approach or
is it assumed to be standing still? Could you explain a bit
further on this?

--> assume limited knowledge of pedestrian dynamics, tout that as a strength of algorithm, robust. introductory paragraph to Sec111-C
    DONE
    
Section VI Summary:
I would expect a title "Conclusions" here.
Also here, it's only mentioned that there has been 100h of
testing, but no furhter results are given. It would be
worthwhile to consider a section: testing results

Comments to the author
======================

-   The introduction clearly states what the problem
is, however, the word “we” is used often.
--> Remove "we"

-   “Sec” and “Section” are both used throughout the
paper, please choose one.

-   The path manager section is vague at best. A
description of the system is given in words, however no
reasoning behind the choices is given. Besides that
numerical values such as distances/times etc. are omitted.
--> give values for buffers (Rakesh)
    DONE

-   Why is there a static buffer and not a
forward/relative velocity dependent one?
--> mention that ds_rstop is dynamic
    -- That guy didn't read the paper. We clearly stateted that ds_rstop is a dynamic buffer.
    DONE

-   “Once this is done, each segment can be compared to
a library of possible jerk profiles to find a good match”.
What is this jerk library? Is this not defined by the
dynamics of the vehicle in question?
--> "The order in which they are attempted is: 7 → 6 → 4 / 4R → 3."" Refer to this as jerk library
    DONE

-   “Additionally, the desired positive and negative
acceleration am = [a+ m; a&#1048576; m] and the desired
positive and negative jerk jm = [j+m ; j&#1048576;m ] must
be defined for each segment.” Why do they need to be
defined for each segment? Please elaborate.

---> mention that different values for each segment are possible (traction in different surfaces, school zone sedate driving) However for this work, the values are the same for each segment.
    DONE

-   “For instance, acceleration constraints may include
a set of limits derived from friction coefficients at every
point along the sub-path.” Why do you consider friction
limits if human comfort is of importance? Typically,
accelerations remain small. 

---> mention again that variety of ceilings can be used concurrently
    DONE

-   The approximation of the forward velocity does not
consider negative lateral accelerations properly, this will
now become a complex number, i.e. also formulate a lower
bound or include the absolute value. 
--> mention abs
    DONE

-   I have missed the introduction of “algorithm 8”. 

-   It would be greatly appreciated if the different
phased algorithms are explained using math instead of
words. 
--> add jerk profiles
    DONE
