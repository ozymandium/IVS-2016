Cur- rent approaches to compute arc length or to construct an arc-length parameterized curve are impractical to use in real-time applications.

abstract = {—A new approach based on interval analysis is devel-oped to find the global minimum-jerk (MJ) trajectory of a robot manipulator within a joint space scheme using cubic splines. MJ trajectories are desirable for their similarity to human joint move-ments and for their amenability to path tracking and to limit robot vibrations. This makes them attractive choices for robotic appli-cations, in spite of the fact that the manipulator dynamics is not taken into account. Cubic splines are used in a framework that as-sures overall continuity of velocities and accelerations in the robot movement. The resulting MJ trajectory planning is shown to be a global constrained minimax optimization problem. This is solved by a newly devised algorithm based on interval analysis and proof of convergence with certainty to an arbitrarily good global solu-tion is provided. The proposed planning method is applied to an example regarding a six-joint manipulator and comparisons with an alternative MJ planner are exposed.},

We present two approaches with different computational complexities. In the first approach, we formulate the MPC problem by using a nonlinear vehicle model. The second approach is based on successive online linearization of the vehicle model. Discussions on computational complexity and performance of the two schemes are presented. The effectiveness of the proposed MPC formulation is demonstrated by simulation and experimental tests up to 21 m/s on icy roads},

Approximation for optimal motion needs a global path planning algorithm that precisely calculates the whole dynamics of a machine in a brief calculation. We propose a path planning algorithm that is composed of a path searching algorithm and a pruning algorithm. The pruning algorithm is based on our analysis for the resemblances of states. To confirm the precision, calculation cost, optimality, and applicability of the proposed algorithm, we conducted several shortest time path planning examinations for the dynamic models of double inverted pendulums. The precision to reach the goal state of the pendulums was better than other algorithms. The calculation was at least 58 times faster. There was a positive correlation between the optimality and the resolutions of the proposed algorithm. As a result of torque based feedback control simulation, we confirmed applicability of the proposed algorithm under noisy situation.},

abstract = {While linear model predictive control is popular since the 70s of the past century, the 90s have witnessed a steadily increasing attention from control theoretists as well as control practitioners in the area of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). The practical interest is driven by the fact that today’s processes need to be operated under tighter performance specifications. At the same time more and more constraints, stemming for example from environmental and safety considerations, need to be satisfied. Often these demands can only be met when process nonlinearities and constraints are explicitly considered in the controller. Nonlinear predictive control, the extension of well established linear predictive control to the nonlinear world, appears to be a well suited approach for this kind of problems. In this note the basic principle of NMPC is reviewed, the key advantages/disadvantages of NMPC are outlined and some of the theoretical, computational, and implementational aspects of NMPC are discussed. Furthermore, some of the currently open questions in the area of NMPC are outlined.},

tested in simulations for motion on an inclined plane. This is done to
prepare future work regarding the avoidance of the violation of the
smoothness condition for exact linearization, while at the same time by
modifying the input commands the geometric path planning results are
conserved. The approach is presented for the wheel-ground slippage and

@article{Zakaria2013,
abstract = {Trajectory tracking is an important aspect of autonomous vehicles. The idea behind trajectory tracking is the ability of the vehicle to follow a predefined path with zero steady state error. The difficulty arises due to the nonlinearity of vehicle dynamics. Therefore, this paper proposes a stable tracking control for an autonomous vehicle. An approach that consists of steering wheel control and lateral control is introduced. This control algorithm is used for a non-holonomic navigation problem, namely tracking a reference trajectory in a closed loop form. A proposed future prediction point control algorithm is used to calculate the vehicle's lateral error in order to improve the performance of the trajectory tracking. A feedback sensor signal from the steering wheel angle and yaw rate sensor is used as feedback information for the controller. The controller consists of a relationship between the future point lateral error, the linear velocity, the heading error and the reference yaw rate. This paper also introduces a spike detection algorithm to track the spike error that occurs during GPS reading. The proposed idea is to take the advantage of the derivative of the steering rate. This paper aims to tackle the lateral error problem by applying the steering control law to the vehicle, and proposes a new path tracking control method by considering the future coordinate of the vehicle and the future estimated lateral error. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated by a simulation and a GPS experiment with noisy data. The approach used in this paper is not limited to autonomous vehicles alone since the concept of autonomous vehicle tracking can be used in mobile robot platforms, as the kinematic model of these two platforms is similar.

The work presented here focuses on the control of a nonholonomic ground vehicle as it tracks a given path. A new path tracking technique called ‘‘vector pursuit’’ is presented. This new technique is based on the theory of screws, which was developed by Sir Robert Ball in 1900. It generates a desired vehicle turning radius based on the ve- hicle’s current position and orientation relative to the position of a point ahead on the planned path and the desired orientation along the path at that point. The vector pursuit algorithm is compared to other geometrical approaches, and it is shown to be more ro- bust, resulting in more accurate path tracking.},

abstract = {We address the problem of position trajectory-tracking and path-following control design for underactuated autonomous vehicles in the presence of possibly large modeling parametric uncertainty. For a general class of vehicles moving in either 2- or 3-D space, we demonstrate how adaptive switching supervisory control can be combined with a nonlinear Lyapunov-based tracking control law to solve the problem of global boundedness and convergence of the position tracking error to a neighborhood of the origin that can be made arbitrarily small. The desired trajectory does not need to be of a particular type (e.g., trimming trajectories) and can be any sufficiently smooth bounded curve parameterized by time. We also show how these results can be applied to solve the path-following problem, in which the vehicle is required to converge to and follow a path, without a specific temporal specification. We illustrate our design procedures through two vehicle control applications: a hovercraft (moving on a planar surface) and an underwater vehicle (moving in 3-D space). Simulations results are presented and discussed.},

abstract = { Industrial manipulators driven by impulse-controlled servo motors commonly follow prescribed reference-trajectories which enable smooth movements (no discontinuity in acceleration profile). On-line generation of such smooth trajectories as a consequence of new target-settings during the motion, however, still suffers from the high computational effort for calculating an optimum solution, as far as the maximum limiting values of velocity, acceleration and jerk are taken into account. An additional problem increased by on-line target changes are position and speed deviations from the desired values at the final end-point, caused by the limited accuracy of clock-controlled pulse generation using a DSP or microcontroller and results in an undesired "creep" motion. In this paper we present a method for generating smooth motion reference-trajectory starting from the current velocity and acceleration and taking into account all given constraints. The calculation is based on purely kinematic models and is easy to implement as a real-time algorithm. Furthermore, a control loop for the correction of pulse generation using predicted position errors is proposed to eliminate the "creep" motion. Simulation and experimental results obtained by application of the proposed method to a pick and place machine using a microcontroller SAB C167 are presented.},

abstract = {This paper derives a new type of control law to steer the dynamic model of a wheeled robot of unicycle type along a desired spatial path. The methodology adopted for path following control deals explicitly with vehicle dynamics and plant parameter uncertainty. Furthermore, it overcomes stringent initial condition constraints that are present in a number of path following control strategies described in the literature. This is done by controlling explicitly the rate of progression of a "virtual target" to be tracked along the path, thus bypassing the problems that arise when the position of the virtual target is simply defined by the projection of the actual vehicle on that path. The nonlinear adaptive control law proposed yields convergence of the (closed loop system) path following error trajectories to zero. Controller design relies on Lyapunov theory and backstepping techniques. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the control system proposed.},

abstract = {This paper presents a path and speed planner for automated public transport vehicles in unstructured environments. Since efficiency and comfort are two of the key issues in promoting this kind of transportation system, they are dealt with explicitly in the proposed planning algorithm. To that end, a global path planner has been designed with bounded continuous curvature and bounded curvature derivative to ensure smooth driving. This will allow the public transport system to know a priori which is the shortest path within a selected area that guarantees lateral accelerations and steering wheel speeds below given pre-set thresholds. A closed-form speed profiler uses semantic information provided by the path planner to set a continuous velocity reference that takes into account not only bounds on lateral and longitudinal accelerations consistent with comfort, but also a bound on longitudinal jerk. The suitability of the above two features was compared to manual driving in a real instrumented public transport vehicle on a test track. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

A comparative evaluation of these three models and the previously known constant and linear-decreasing acceleration models is reported. The evaluation criteria are distance traveled and fuel consumed during acceleration. The performances of the five models are compared under three sets of conditions: acceleration time and distance known, time known but distance unknown, and both time and distance unknown. The comparisons are made separately for central business district ({\{}CBD){\}}, other urban and nonurban traffic conditions. The polynomial model has been found to be the best overall for predicting acceleration distance and fuel consumption. Similar results have been found for deceleration profiles. Dependence of fuel consumption on acceleration rate and profile is also discussed. Suggestions for further work using the results of this report are included.},

abstract = {Vehicle crashes at horizontal curves account for 42 percent of lane departure crashes on roadways. The risks of crashes on horizontal curves have been reported to be about 1.4 to 5 times greater than that for tangent sections. Twenty-five percent of the total number of fatal crashes in the United States occurred on horizontal curves. Driver error due to situational complexity has been cited as major factors run-off-road or cross-centerline crashes at horizontal curves. Major causes of crashes on horizontal curves include abrupt changes in vehicle operating speed and failure to maintain proper lane position within the horizontal curve, as well as other factors. The literature documents many investigations of these factors. This dissertation presents a methodology to develop and analyze vehicle trajectories and speed profiles at horizontal curves. Key research objectives included evaluating appropriate methods and equipment to gather and analyze data for individual vehicles, developing statistical models to predict vehicle speed and lateral position, and comparing speeds and lateral positions of different types of vehicles as they traverse a horizontal curve. To compare the accuracy and efficiency of commonly used traffic data collection methods, pneumatic road tubes and video data recording systems were used to gather data related to vehicle speed and lateral position. After initial tests on a closed parking lot, a more extensive experiment was conducted on a horizontal curve that was closed to traffic. The setup for this had seven stations with each station consisting of a set of pneumatic tubes placed in a z-configuration, and a trailer with the video equipment placed on the roadway shoulder. The video equipment consisted of 4 cameras: 2 cameras on a mast at about 35 feet above the roadway and 2 cameras placed on the trailer at a height of about 7 feet above the roadway surface. Observations were made during day time and night time based on capabilities afforded by the equipment. Potential impacts of the data collection equipment on driver behavior were also examined. A repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare vehicle trajectories and speed profiles to evaluate the accuracy of the measurements. The results from this study showed that pneumatic road tubes could be used to obtain vehicle speeds, lateral positions and trajectories along horizontal curves at a high degree of accuracy in a cost effective and time efficient manner. The presence of the trailer with the video recording equipment seemed to affect driver behavior. Also, it was felt that 7 stations (with z-configurations) may affect driver behavior. So, fewer stations would minimize such impacts on driver behavior. In the second study, vehicle, roadway, and environmental factors at two horizontal field locations are analyzed (one urban and one rural). An OLS model is developed to predict vehicle speed and lateral position along a curve based on a vehicle's curve entry speed and lateral position. Variables such as direction of travel, time of day, type of vehicle, pavement condition (wet/dry), and opposing vehicles are found to significantly influence vehicle trajectories and speeds. The third study of this dissertation presents an exploratory analysis of vehicle trajectories and speed profiles. Trajectory data from both curve sites primarily reveal cutting or normal pathways. The analyses show that deviations vehicle speeds and lateral position varied as drivers traverse the curve, and that these changes were statistically significant at the 95 percent confidence level. Further, the means of the maximum speed and lateral deviation of passenger cars were greater than those for heavy vehicles along the horizontal curves.},

abstract = {Modelling of acceleration and deceleration distances and times associated with speed change cycles (stop - start and slow down - speed up manoeuvres) under normal driving conditions is essential for the analysis of operating cost, fuel consumption and pollutant emissions, as well as for determining geometric, stopped and queuing components of overall delay (Akcelik and Associates 2002). Similarly, modelling of acceleration and deceleration characteristics of individual vehicles is a key issue in relation to the accuracy of microsimulation models (Ak{\c{c}}elik and Besley 2002). A polynomial model of acceleration and deceleration profiles was derived for estimating instantaneous acceleration and deceleration rates, and the model was calibrated using extensive real-life driving data representing general driving conditions, i.e. involving a wide range of speeds change cycles on different road types (Ak{\c{c}}elik and Biggs 1987). The model parameters were adjusted for use in intersection analysis on the basis of acceleration and deceleration rates reported in the literature in order to obtain more realistic values representing stop-start conditions at intersections. Further adjustments have been made to model parameters recently for use in aaSIDRA version 2 making use of acceleration time and distance information derived from queue discharge characteristics at signalised intersections (Akcelik and Associates 2002). This paper describes the acceleration and deceleration models, and emphasises the research needs for better model calibration considering different vehicle types (cars, buses, trucks), specific traffic facilities (roundabouts, signalised and sign-controlled intersections, signalised and unsignalised pedestrian crossings, freeways), different traffic demand levels (light, medium, heavy), road types (urban, rural roads, city centre, suburban), and a wide range of initial and final speeds.},

general terrains is presented that obtains the geometric path and
vehicle speeds that minimize motion time considering vehicle dynamics,
terrain topography, obstacles, and surface mobility. The terrain is
represented by a smooth cubic <e1>B</e1> patch, and the geometric path
consists of a <e1>B</e1> spline curve mapped to the surface. The
time-optimal motions are computed by first obtaining the best
obstacle-free path from all paths represented by a uniform grid. This
path is further optimized using a local optimization procedure, using
the optimal motion time along the path as the cost function and the
control points of a <e1>B</e1> spline as the optimizing parameters.
Examples are presented that demonstrate the method for a simple dynamic
model of a vehicle moving on mountainous terrain},

@misc{Kant1986,
abstract = {We present a novel approach to solving the trajectory plan ning problem (TPP) in time-varying environments. The es sence of our approach lies in a heuristic but natural decom position of TPP into two subproblems: (1) planning a path to avoid collision with static obstacles and (2) planning the velocity along the path to avoid collision with moving obsta cles. We call thefirst subproblem the path planning problem (PPP) and the second the velocity planning problem (VPP). Thus, our decomposition is summarized by the equation TPP => PPP + VPP. The symbol => indicates that the de composition holds under certain assumptions, e.g., when obstacles are moving independently of (i.e., not tracking ) the robot. Furthermore, we pose the VPP in path-time space, where time is explicitly represented as an extra dimension, and reduce it to a graph search in this space. In fact, VPP is transformed to a two-dimensional PPP in path-time space with some additional constraints. Algorithms are then pre sented to solve the VPP with different optimality criteria: minimum length in path-time space, and minimum time.},

We suggest a local, continuous method that is derived from a variational formulation. The solution trajectory is the constrained extremum of an objective function that is designed to express dynamic feasibility and comfort. Static and dynamic obstacle constraints are incorporated in the form of polygons. The constraints are carefully designed to ensure that the solution converges to a single, global optimum.},
