abstract = {Parametric curves are frequently used in computer an- imation and virtual environments to control the movements of syn- thetic objects. In many of these applications it is essential to effi- ciently relate parameter values to the arc length of the curve. Cur- rent approaches to compute arc length or to construct an arc-length parameterized curve are impractical to use in real-time applications. This paper presents a simple and efficient technique to generate ap- proximately arc-length parameterized spline curves that closely match spline curves typically used to model roads in high-fidelity driving sim- ulators.},

abstract = {—A new approach based on interval analysis is devel-oped to find the global minimum-jerk (MJ) trajectory of a robot manipulator within a joint space scheme using cubic splines. MJ trajectories are desirable for their similarity to human joint move-ments and for their amenability to path tracking and to limit robot vibrations. This makes them attractive choices for robotic appli-cations, in spite of the fact that the manipulator dynamics is not taken into account. Cubic splines are used in a framework that as-sures overall continuity of velocities and accelerations in the robot movement. The resulting MJ trajectory planning is shown to be a global constrained minimax optimization problem. This is solved by a newly devised algorithm based on interval analysis and proof of convergence with certainty to an arbitrarily good global solu-tion is provided. The proposed planning method is applied to an example regarding a six-joint manipulator and comparisons with an alternative MJ planner are exposed.},

For future ADAS, relevant to traffic safety, high precision digital maps including detailed information about the course of individual lanes are needed. We introduce a new method for the generation of highly accurate digital maps including lane specific information based on a wide range of raw data sources. We show that the use of arc splines as a representation model of individual lanes is advantageous for both computational efficiency and accuracy. Therefore, this method is useful for a wide variety of applications using digital maps to enrich driving comfort and traffic safety.},

At each time step, a trajectory is assumed to be known over a finite horizon, and an MPC controller computes the front steering angle in order to follow the trajectory on slippery roads at the highest possible entry speed. We present two approaches with different computational complexities. In the first approach, we formulate the MPC problem by using a nonlinear vehicle model. The second approach is based on successive online linearization of the vehicle model. Discussions on computational complexity and performance of the two schemes are presented. The effectiveness of the proposed MPC formulation is demonstrated by simulation and experimental tests up to 21 m/s on icy roads},

abstract = {This paper addresses optimal motion for general machines. Approximation for optimal motion needs a global path planning algorithm that precisely calculates the whole dynamics of a machine in a brief calculation. We propose a path planning algorithm that is composed of a path searching algorithm and a pruning algorithm. The pruning algorithm is based on our analysis for the resemblances of states. To confirm the precision, calculation cost, optimality, and applicability of the proposed algorithm, we conducted several shortest time path planning examinations for the dynamic models of double inverted pendulums. The precision to reach the goal state of the pendulums was better than other algorithms. The calculation was at least 58 times faster. There was a positive correlation between the optimality and the resolutions of the proposed algorithm. As a result of torque based feedback control simulation, we confirmed applicability of the proposed algorithm under noisy situation.},

abstract = {Low-cost inertial sensors are characterized by high noise and large uncertainties in the outputs such as bias, scale factor and non-orthogonality. Consequently, errors associated with a low-cost INS in terms of position, velocity and attitude grow rapidly in stand-alone mode. If good performance can be achieved with low-cost inertial measurement units (IMUs), cost in existing applications can be reduced and the development of new applications may be made feasible. As most of the uncertainties exist in the sensor error behaviour, calibration would improve the accuracy significantly. Intensive calibration, however, would also increase the cost of using an IMU. Another way to improve the accuracy will be by augmenting the IMU with many other aiding sensors: for example, odometers or speedometers. Choosing an appropriate estimation method is a key problem when developing an aided INS. Currently, there are three approaches: (i) traditional linearized Kalman filter (LKF) or the extended Kalman filter (EKF); (ii) sampling-based filtering such as the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and particle filters; (iii) artificial intelligence (AI)-based estimation such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neural fuzzy information systems (ANFIS). Of these approaches, the performance of the UKF is compared to that of other existing methods. The performance of the unscented Kalman smoother (UKS) is also compared with that of the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother. Tests have been conducted using micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)-based IMUs. The most remarkable advantage of the UKF over existing methods is that it can handle large and small attitude errors seamlessly. Thus, the UKF is preferred in situations such as those where the heading error approaches the limit of what an EKF/LKF can deal with efficiently. The EKF/RTS approach would still be chosen if the attitude errors can be kept small such that the error dynamics are linear. The UKF can unify INS error models, although it cannot deal with complete uncertainties in attitude. Therefore, the development stage can be simplified by using the UKF.},

abstract = {While linear model predictive control is popular since the 70s of the past century, the 90s have witnessed a steadily increasing attention from control theoretists as well as control practitioners in the area of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). The practical interest is driven by the fact that today’s processes need to be operated under tighter performance specifications. At the same time more and more constraints, stemming for example from environmental and safety considerations, need to be satisfied. Often these demands can only be met when process nonlinearities and constraints are explicitly considered in the controller. Nonlinear predictive control, the extension of well established linear predictive control to the nonlinear world, appears to be a well suited approach for this kind of problems. In this note the basic principle of NMPC is reviewed, the key advantages/disadvantages of NMPC are outlined and some of the theoretical, computational, and implementational aspects of NMPC are discussed. Furthermore, some of the currently open questions in the area of NMPC are outlined.},

abstract = {Trajectory tracking is an important aspect of autonomous vehicles. The idea behind trajectory tracking is the ability of the vehicle to follow a predefined path with zero steady state error. The difficulty arises due to the nonlinearity of vehicle dynamics. Therefore, this paper proposes a stable tracking control for an autonomous vehicle. An approach that consists of steering wheel control and lateral control is introduced. This control algorithm is used for a non-holonomic navigation problem, namely tracking a reference trajectory in a closed loop form. A proposed future prediction point control algorithm is used to calculate the vehicle's lateral error in order to improve the performance of the trajectory tracking. A feedback sensor signal from the steering wheel angle and yaw rate sensor is used as feedback information for the controller. The controller consists of a relationship between the future point lateral error, the linear velocity, the heading error and the reference yaw rate. This paper also introduces a spike detection algorithm to track the spike error that occurs during GPS reading. The proposed idea is to take the advantage of the derivative of the steering rate. This paper aims to tackle the lateral error problem by applying the steering control law to the vehicle, and proposes a new path tracking control method by considering the future coordinate of the vehicle and the future estimated lateral error. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated by a simulation and a GPS experiment with noisy data. The approach used in this paper is not limited to autonomous vehicles alone since the concept of autonomous vehicle tracking can be used in mobile robot platforms, as the kinematic model of these two platforms is similar.

This new technique is based on the theory of screws, which was developed by Sir Robert Ball in 1900. It generates a desired vehicle turning radius based on the ve- hicle’s current position and orientation relative to the position of a point ahead on the planned path and the desired orientation along the path at that point.

For a general class of vehicles moving in either 2- or 3-D space, we demonstrate how adaptive switching supervisory control can be combined with a nonlinear Lyapunov-based tracking control law to solve the problem of global boundedness and convergence of the position tracking error to a neighborhood of the origin that can be made arbitrarily small. The desired trajectory does not need to be of a particular type (e.g., trimming trajectories) and can be any sufficiently smooth bounded curve parameterized by time. We also show how these results can be applied to solve the path-following problem, in which the vehicle is required to converge to and follow a path, without a specific temporal specification. We illustrate our design procedures through two vehicle control applications: a hovercraft (moving on a planar surface) and an underwater vehicle (moving in 3-D space).

abstract = { Industrial manipulators driven by impulse-controlled servo motors commonly follow prescribed reference-trajectories which enable smooth movements (no discontinuity in acceleration profile). On-line generation of such smooth trajectories as a consequence of new target-settings during the motion, however, still suffers from the high computational effort for calculating an optimum solution, as far as the maximum limiting values of velocity, acceleration and jerk are taken into account. An additional problem increased by on-line target changes are position and speed deviations from the desired values at the final end-point, caused by the limited accuracy of clock-controlled pulse generation using a DSP or microcontroller and results in an undesired "creep" motion. In this paper we present a method for generating smooth motion reference-trajectory starting from the current velocity and acceleration and taking into account all given constraints. The calculation is based on purely kinematic models and is easy to implement as a real-time algorithm. Furthermore, a control loop for the correction of pulse generation using predicted position errors is proposed to eliminate the "creep" motion. Simulation and experimental results obtained by application of the proposed method to a pick and place machine using a microcontroller SAB C167 are presented.},

The methodology adopted for path following control deals explicitly with vehicle dynamics and plant parameter uncertainty. Furthermore, it overcomes stringent initial condition constraints that are present in a number of path following control strategies described in the literature. This is done by controlling explicitly the rate of progression of a "virtual target" to be tracked along the path, thus bypassing the problems that arise when the position of the virtual target is simply defined by the projection of the actual vehicle on that path. The nonlinear adaptive control law proposed yields convergence of the (closed loop system) path following error trajectories to zero. Controller design relies on Lyapunov theory and backstepping techniques. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the control system proposed.},

This will allow the public transport system to know a priori which is the shortest path within a selected area that guarantees lateral accelerations and steering wheel speeds below given pre-set thresholds. A closed-form speed profiler uses semantic information provided by the path planner to set a continuous velocity reference that takes into account not only bounds on lateral and longitudinal accelerations consistent with comfort, but also a bound on longitudinal jerk. The suitability of the above two features was compared to manual driving in a real instrumented public transport vehicle on a test track. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

First a trajectory planner attaches a speed component to the postures of a path by considering speed limitations introduced by the vehicle and by task specifications. In order to provide robustness during task execution in the real world, environment feedback is used to dynamically adjust the speed of the vehicle to the presence of unexpected obstacles, both static and mobile. This is accomplished by combining the planned speed profile with the outputs of two reactive controllers.

A comparative evaluation of these three models and the previously known constant and linear-decreasing acceleration models is reported. The evaluation criteria are distance traveled and fuel consumed during acceleration. The performances of the five models are compared under three sets of conditions: acceleration time and distance known, time known but distance unknown, and both time and distance unknown. The comparisons are made separately for central business district ({\{}CBD){\}}, other urban and nonurban traffic conditions. The polynomial model has been found to be the best overall for predicting acceleration distance and fuel consumption. Similar results have been found for deceleration profiles. Dependence of fuel consumption on acceleration rate and profile is also discussed. Suggestions for further work using the results of this report are included.},

abstract = {Modelling of acceleration and deceleration distances and times associated with speed change cycles (stop - start and slow down - speed up manoeuvres) under normal driving conditions is essential for the analysis of operating cost, fuel consumption and pollutant emissions, as well as for determining geometric, stopped and queuing components of overall delay (Akcelik and Associates 2002). Similarly, modelling of acceleration and deceleration characteristics of individual vehicles is a key issue in relation to the accuracy of microsimulation models (Ak{\c{c}}elik and Besley 2002). A polynomial model of acceleration and deceleration profiles was derived for estimating instantaneous acceleration and deceleration rates, and the model was calibrated using extensive real-life driving data representing general driving conditions, i.e. involving a wide range of speeds change cycles on different road types (Ak{\c{c}}elik and Biggs 1987). The model parameters were adjusted for use in intersection analysis on the basis of acceleration and deceleration rates reported in the literature in order to obtain more realistic values representing stop-start conditions at intersections. Further adjustments have been made to model parameters recently for use in aaSIDRA version 2 making use of acceleration time and distance information derived from queue discharge characteristics at signalised intersections (Akcelik and Associates 2002). This paper describes the acceleration and deceleration models, and emphasises the research needs for better model calibration considering different vehicle types (cars, buses, trucks), specific traffic facilities (roundabouts, signalised and sign-controlled intersections, signalised and unsignalised pedestrian crossings, freeways), different traffic demand levels (light, medium, heavy), road types (urban, rural roads, city centre, suburban), and a wide range of initial and final speeds.},

The es sence of our approach lies in a heuristic but natural decom position of TPP into two subproblems: (1) planning a path to avoid collision with static obstacles and (2) planning the velocity along the path to avoid collision with moving obsta cles. We call thefirst subproblem the path planning problem (PPP) and the second the velocity planning problem (VPP). Thus, our decomposition is summarized by the equation TPP => PPP + VPP. The symbol => indicates that the de composition holds under certain assumptions, e.g., when obstacles are moving independently of (i.e., not tracking ) the robot. Furthermore, we pose the VPP in path-time space, where time is explicitly represented as an extra dimension, and reduce it to a graph search in this space. In fact, VPP is transformed to a two-dimensional PPP in path-time space with some additional constraints. Algorithms are then pre sented to solve the VPP with different optimality criteria: minimum length in path-time space, and minimum time.},

abstract = {Matching a noisy input location to the road network has a large number of location-based appli- cations. Traditional map matching techniques have been applied largely to the relatively accurate GPS location estimates. These relatively clean GPS location estimates are not available in a growing number of applications such as traffic estimation from the cellular provider side (where only the associated cell tower and signal strength information is available for each cell phone), applications that involve low-end phones or embedded devices, and crowd-sensing applications where the GPS is usually turned off. In such scenarios, the typical assumptions of traditional map matching algorithms do not hold, leading to new challenges including input locations that are far from the actual road segment, errors in the order of kilometers, back-and-forth transitions, and highly sparse input data. These harsh conditions lead to a much harder map matching problem, in terms of quality of input points and number of candidate road segments, affecting both the accuracy and computation complexity. In this paper, we present the SnapNet system which provides accurate real-time map matching for cellular-based trajectory traces. SnapNet applies a series of filters to handle the noisy locations and an interpolation stage to address the data sparseness. At the core of SnapNet is a novel incremental HMM algorithm that combines digital map hints in the estimation process and a number of heuristics to reduce the noise and provide real-time estimation. Evaluation of SnapNet using actual traces from different cities covering more than 100km shows that SnapNet can achieve a precision and recall of more than 90{\%} under noisy coarse-grained input location estimates. This maps to over 97{\%} and 34{\%} enhancement in precision and recall respectively when compared to traditional HMM map matching algorithms. Moreover, SnapNet has a latency of 1.2ms per location estimate, highlighting its promise for a new class of challenging environments.},

abstract = {This thesis documents the development of algorithms for an inertial navigation system (INS). In general, inertial navigation consists of three parts: Alignment, navigation and aiding. Algorithms for these parts are derived in this thesis. In order to create reproducable test data for verifi- cation and analysis of the algorithms, an earth simu- lation model is developed. The algorithms were also tested against a reference INS, a Kearfott T16 INS, to verify that the algorithms also work on real-world data with real noise sources. The navigation equations needed for an INS for ter- restrial navigation are developed and tested against the reference INS. Tests showed that the developed navigation equations were able to follow the reference trajectory to a satisfactory degree, thus validating the navigation equations. The alignment algorithms make use of an indirect Kalman filter, which estimates the errors in the INS states. For this, an error model is developed, which describes the propagation of errors within the INS. An alignment algorithm is developed to estimate tilt and heading of the system. The alignment algorithm was verified against data from the reference system, and was shown to be able to estimate tilt and heading to a satisfactory degree. Algorithms for aiding the INS navigation equations were developed for a speedometer and a GPS. These algorithms also use the indirect Kalman filter and the error model. Using data from the reference system together with GPS measurements, it was shown that the developed algorithms were able to aid the naviga- tion equations and produce better results than either of the systems in a standalone setup. It was also shown that the INS was able to track position during GPS outages.},

Compared to the existing distributed implementations of the particle filter, the CD/UPF offers two advantages. First, it uses all available local observations including the most recent ones in deriving the proposal distribution. Second, computation of global estimates from local estimates during the consensus step is based on an optimal fusion rule. In our bearing-only tracking simulations, the performance of the proposed CD/UPF is virtually indistinguishable from its centralized counterpart.},

abstract = {The global positioning system (GPS) has become the most extensively used positioning and navigation tool in the world. Applications of GPS abound in surveying, mapping, transportation, agriculture, military planning, GIS, and the geosciences. However, the positional and elevation accuracy of any given GPS location is prone to error, due to a number of factors. This has serious implications for some applications, such as real-time navigational systems. GPS accuracy can be significantly improved with additional data, possibly from multiple sources, and especially from multiple receivers. In the case of a single GPS receiver, its position and elevation can be considerably improved with the use of spatial data. For vehicle tracking, map matching can be employed to intelligently snap the GPS location to a road centreline, while height aiding can augment the GPS solution by utilising a digital terrain model (DTM), thereby reducing the number of satellites required to determine a position. This paper describes the use of map matching and height aiding, and examines the effect of different terrain resolutions (Ordnance Survey 1:50,000 and 1:10,000 scale DTMs) on plan position and elevation accuracy for vehicle tracking. Furthermore, the user's choice of interpolation algorithm for estimating heights from the DTM is investigated. The results of the experiments described in this paper demonstrate that height aiding alone reduces the mean error in elevation from 22.5 to 17.5 m for of a single GPS receiver, and the mean error in plan position from 6 to 5 m. However, map matching and height aiding combined, reduces the elevation RMSE of a single GPS receiver from 22.5 m to approximately 4 m (1:50,000 scale DTM) and down to 0.8 m (1:10,000 scale DTM), while the plan position RMSE is reduced from 5.9 to 3.2 m (either DTM). It is also demonstrated that when the number of satellites visible to the receiver is reduced, or the satellite geometry is poor, map matching and height aiding considerably improves the plan and elevation accuracy. The use of a higher-order interpolant (e.g. a bicubic or biquintic polynomial) is shown to slightly improve performance, compared to a bilinear interpolant, for the lower-resolution DTM, but has little overall benefit for the higher resolution DTM. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper presents a new method to optimally combine motion measurements provided by proprioceptive sensors, with relative-state estimates inferred from feature-based matching. Two key challenges arise in such pose tracking problems: 1) the displacement estimates relate the state of the robot at two different time instants and 2) the same exteroceptive measurements are often used for computing consecutive displacement estimates, a process that renders the errors in these correlated. We present a novel stochastic cloning Kalman filtering (SC-KF) estimation algorithm that successfully addresses these challenges, while still allowing for efficient calculation of the filter gains and covariances. The proposed algorithm is not intended to compete with simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approaches. Instead, it can be merged with any extended-Kalman- filter-based SLAM algorithm to increase its precision. In this respect, the SC-KF provides a robust framework for leveraging additional motion information extracted from dense point features that most SLAM algorithms do not treat as landmarks. Extensive experimental and simulation results are presented to verify the validity of the proposed method and to demonstrate that its performance is superior to that of alternative position-tracking approaches.},

abstract = {The satellite-based vehicle tracking system accuracy can be improved by augmenting the positional information using road network data, in a process known as map-matching. Map-matching algorithms attempt to pinpoint the vehicle in a particular road map segment (or any restricting track such as rails, etc), in spite of the digital map errors and navigation system inaccuracies. Point-to-curve matching algorithm is not suitable to the problem since it ignores any historical data and often gave unstable, jumping results. The better curve-to-curve matching algorithms considers the road connectivity and measure the similarity between track and the possible road path (hypotheses), but mostly does not have any way to manage multiple track hypotheses which have varying degree of similarity over time. The paper presents a new similarity metric for curve-to-curve map-matching technique, combined with the ability to maintain many possible road hypotheses and picks the most likely hypothesis at a time, enabling future corrections if necessary, therefore providing intelligent guesses with considerable accuracy.},

As such they fail to utilise the restriction of motor ve- hicles to the road network and thus a valuable source of position information is lost. Techniques exist that make use of map information to improve the position estimate of a motor vehicle but the techniques lack a mathematical framework. The authors have addressed this problem by developing a map-aided position esti- mation system whereby the raw position measurements are optimally translated so that they lie on the roads. The accuracy of the map-aided estimates is derived for an arbitrary positioning system with Gaussian measure- ment noise demonstrating significant improvements over the raw measurements. Further performance improve- ments are achieved through the use of a one-dimensional kalman filter developed to utilise the fact that all of the map-aided position estimates lie along known curves. The mathematical framework utilised by the map-aided estimator readily allows other sources of position infor- mation such as road type and road rules to be quantified and optimally incorporated into the estimation process.},

This method is a decentralized method based on sharing GPS data and inter-vehicular distance measurements within a cluster of vehicles. A Bayesian approach is used to fuse the GPS data and inter-vehicular distances. In order to investigate the performance of this new approach on vehicle localization, a Kalman filter has been employed to incorporate the dynamics of the vehicle. The effect of this method on the reduction of the localization uncertainty, over-convergence issues and identification of the vehicles are also discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {Vehicle tracking data is an essential “raw”ma- terial for a broad range of applications such as traffic management and control, routing, and navigation. An important issue with this data is its accuracy. The method of sampling vehicular movement using GPS is affected by two error sources and consequently produces inaccurate trajectory data. To become use- ful, the data has to be related to the under- lying road network by means of map match- ing algorithms. We present three such algo- rithms that consider especially the trajectory nature of the data rather than simply the cur- rent position as in the typical map-matching case. An incremental algorithm is proposed that matches consecutive portions of the tra- jectory to the road network, effectively trad- ing accuracy for speed of computation. In contrast, the two global algorithms compare the entire trajectory to candidate paths in the road network. The algorithms are evaluated in terms of (i) their running time and (ii) the quality of their matching result. Two novel qualitymeasures utilizing the Fr´ echet distance are introduced and subsequently used in an experimental evaluation to assess the quality of matching real tracking data to a road net- work. 1},

abstract = {Most car navigation systems estimate the car position from dead reckoning and the Global Positioning System (GPS). However, because of the unknown GPS noise, the estimated position has an undesirable error. To solve this problem, a map-matching method is introduced, which uses a digital road map to correct the position error. In this paper, based on analyzing the pure geometry and possibility statistics map matching algorithms, a integrated map matching algorithm based on fuzzy logic is proposed by synthesizing the merits of two methods and the topology relation of the real road network, and using the concept of the fuzzy theory. The real road experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm},

abstract = {Map-matching algorithms integrate positioning data with spatial road network data (roadway centrelines) to identify the correct link on which a vehicle is travelling and to determine the location of a vehicle on a link. A map-matching algorithm could be used as a key component to improve the performance of systems that support the navigation function of intelligent transport systems (ITS). The required horizontal positioning accuracy of such {\{}ITS{\}} applications is in the range of 1{\&}{\#}xa0;m to 40{\&}{\#}xa0;m (95{\%}) with relatively stringent requirements placed on integrity (quality), continuity and system availability. A number of map-matching algorithms have been developed by researchers around the world using different techniques such as topological analysis of spatial road network data, probabilistic theory, Kalman filter, fuzzy logic, and belief theory. The performances of these algorithms have improved over the years due to the application of advanced techniques in the map matching processes and improvements in the quality of both positioning and spatial road network data. However, these algorithms are not always capable of supporting {\{}ITS{\}} applications with high required navigation performance, especially in difficult and complex environments such as dense urban areas. This suggests that research should be directed at identifying any constraints and limitations of existing map matching algorithms as a prerequisite for the formulation of algorithm improvements. The objectives of this paper are thus to uncover the constraints and limitations by an in-depth literature review and to recommend ideas to address them. This paper also highlights the potential impacts of the forthcoming European Galileo system and the European Geostationary Overlay Service (EGNOS) on the performance of map matching algorithms. Although not addressed in detail, the paper also presents some ideas for monitoring the integrity of map-matching algorithms. The map-matching algorithms considered in this paper are generic and do not assume knowledge of {\^{a}}future{\^{a}} information (i.e. based on either cost or time). Clearly, such data would result in relatively simple map-matching algorithms.},

@phdthesis{Andersson2009,
abstract = {In recent years, the use of digital map data with road attributes has spread from in- vehicle navigation systems to more sophisticated driver assistance systems. The data can be used together with a GPS positioning system to provide information about the road network close to the vehicle. The information is sufficient for navigation purposes but for the advanced applications, a more accurate model of the road ahead is needed. This thesis proposes a method for road modelling from commercially available map data using a spline interpolation algorithm. The algorithm has several features, such as a possibility to change the smoothness of the spline and to model intersections and right-hand traffic. The road models can be used in applications where a preview of the road shape is of interest. An example application is also developed; a map supported cruise control. The map supported cruise control uses speed limits and road curvature calculated from the model to automatically adjust the target speed of the cruise control before sharp turns and changes in speed limits. A vehicle model is used to predict the deceleration, which in turn is used to decide when to lower the target speed. The road models are verified against collected GPS-data and it is shown that the models provide better fit to road shape and curvature, compared with the source map data. The improvement is most obvious in sharp curves and intersections. The models were also implemented in a test truck. On-road tests enabled comparison of the driver’s speed with the recommended maximum speed calculated from the road models. The tests showed that the developed models are accurate enough to be used for automatic speed adaption. The on-road tests also showed that the map database environment used has to be improved. For example, speed limits are often missing in the map data and errors were found in the position mapping. The map supported cruise control worked well in the few test drives conducted. To improve and expand its use the brakes of the truck must be utilised. Unfortunately, this was not achieved in this study. The final conclusion is that the concept, or a simplified version of it, is promising and might be considered as a feature in future trucks.},

@article{Wan2000,
abstract = {The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has become a standard technique used in a number of nonlinear estimation and ma- chine learning applications. These include estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamic system, estimating parame- ters for nonlinear system identification (e.g., learning the weights of a neural network), and dual estimation (e.g., the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) where both states and parameters are estimated simultaneously. This paper points out the flaws in using the EKF, and introduces an improvement, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), proposed by Julier and Uhlman [SJ. A central and vital operation performed in the Kalman Filter is the prop- agation of a Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics. In the EKF, the state distribution is ap- proximated by a GRV, which is then propagated analyti- cally through the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the true posterior mean and covariance of the transformed GRV, which may lead to sub-optimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter. The UKF addresses this problem by using a deterministic sampling approach. The state distribution is again approximated by a GRV, but is now represented using a minimal set of carefully chosen sample points. These sam- ple points completely capture the true mean and covariance of the GRV, and when propagated through the true non- linear system, captures the posterior mean and covariance accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series expansion) for any nonlinearity. The EKF, in contrast, only achieves first-order accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the UKF is the same order as that of the EKE Julier and Uhlman demonstrated the substantial perfor- mance gains of the UKF in the context of "estimation for nonlinear control. Machine learning problems were not considered. We extend the use of the UKF to a broader class of nonlinear estimation problems, including nonlinear sys- tem identification, training of neural networks, and dual es- timation problems. Our preliminary results were presented in [13]. In this paper, the algorithms are further developed and illustrated with a number of additional examples.},

In addition to standard GMTI sensor measurements, one is interested in using non-standard information such as road maps, and terrain-related visibility conditions to enhance tracker performance. The conventional approach to this problem has been to use the variable structure IMM (VS-IMM), which uses the concept of directional process noise to model motion along particular roads. In this paper, we present a particle filter based approach to this problem which we call variable structure multiple model particle filter (VS-MMPF). Simulation results show that the performance of the VS-MMPF is much superior to that of VS-IMM.},

@phdthesis{Tornqvist2006,
abstract = {This thesis deals with the problem of detecting faults in an environment where the mea- surements are affected by additive noise. To do this, a residual sensitive to faults is derived and statistical methods are used to distinguish faults from noise. Standard methods for fault detection compare a batch of data with a model of the system using the generalized likelihood ratio. Careful treatment of the initial state of the model is quite important, in particular for short batch sizes. One method to handle this is the parity-space method which solves the problemby removing the influence of the initial state using a projection. In this thesis, the case where prior knowledge about the initial state is available is treated. This can be obtained for example from a Kalman filter . Combining the prior estimate with a minimum variance estimate from the data batch results in a smoothed estimate. The influence of the estimated initial state is then removed. It is also shown that removing the influence of the initial state by an estimate fromthe data batch will result in the parity-space method. To model slowly changing faults, an efficient parameterization using Chebyshev polynomials is given. The methods described above have been applied to an I n e r t i a l M e a s u r e m e n t U n i t , IMU. The IMU usually consists of accelerometers and gyroscopes, but has in this work been extendedwith a magnetometer. Traditionally, the IMU has been used to estimate po- sition and orientation of airplanes,missiles etc. Recently, the size and cost has decreased making it possible to use IMU:s for applications such as augmented reality and body mo- tion analysis. Since a magnetometer is very sensitive to disturbances from metal, such disturbances have to be detected. Detection of the disturbancesmakes compensation pos- sible. Another topic covered is the fundamental question of observability for fault inputs. Given a fixed or linearly growing fault, conditions for observability are given. Themeasurements fromthe IMU showthat the noise distribution of the sensors can be well approximated with white Gaussian noise. This gives good correspondence between practical and theoretical results when the sensor is kept at rest. The disturbances for the IMU can be approximated using smooth functions with respect to time. Low rank parameterizations can therefore be used to describe the disturbances. The results show that the use of smoothing to obtain the initial state estimate and parameterization of the disturbances improves the detection performance drastically.},

abstract = {In this paper, we provide a straightforward proof of an important, but nevertheless little known, result obtained by Lindley in the framework of subjective probability theory. This result, once interpreted in the machine learning/pattern recognition context, puts new light on the probabilistic interpretation of the output of a trained classifier. A learning machine, or more generally a model, is usually trained by minimizing a criterion-the expectation of the cost function-measuring the discrepancy between the model output and the desired output. In this letter, we first show that, for the binary classification case, training the model with any "reasonable cost function" can lead to Bayesian a posteriori probability estimation. Indeed, after having trained the model by minimizing the criterion, there always exists a computable transformation that maps the output of the model to the Bayesian a posteriori probability of the class membership given the input. Then, necessary conditions allowing the computation of the transformation mapping the outputs of the model to the a posteriori probabilities are derived for the multioutput case. Finally, these theoretical results are illustrated through some simulation examples involving various cost functions.},

We have developed an unscented particle filter, where the particles model the uncertainty over the motion model while, conditional upon the model, the target state is modelled using an unscented Kalman filter. Simulation results show that the UPF-based filter gives performance similar to the VS-MMPF with significantly fewer particles and better results than the standard VS-IMM approach.},

The UT is a method for pre- dicting means and covariances in nonlinear systems. A set of samples are deterministically chosen which match the mean and covariance of a (not necessarily Gaussian-distributed) probabil- ity distribution. These samples can be scaled by an arbitrary constant. The method guarantees that the mean and covariance second order accuracy in mean and covariance, giving the same performance as a second order truncated filter but without the need to calculate any Jacobians or Hessians. The impacts of scal- ing issues are illustrated by considering conversions from polar to Cartesian coordinates with large angular uncertainties.},

Assuming vehicles are equipped with proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors (with biases) to cooperatively localize positions, a simultaneous solution for joint spatial registration and state estimation is proposed. For this, we rely on the sequential Monte Carlo implementation of the PHD filtering. Compared to other methods, the concept of multiple vehicle cooperative localization with spatial registration is first proposed under Random Finite Set Theory. In addition, the proposed solution also addresses the challenges for multiple vehicle cooperative localization, e.g., the communication bandwidth issue and data association uncertainty.

As a result, we find that the algorithm outperforms standard particle filtering and other nonlinear filtering methods very substantially.

abstract = {In this thesis several new Kalman filter based tracking algorithms for GPS software receivers are presented. Traditional receivers use Costas loops and Delay Lock Loops (DLL) to track the carrier and Pseudo-Random Noise (PRN) signals broadcast by the GPS satellites, respectively. The tasks of tracking the the carrier and PRN signals are done separately. The Kalman filter based algorithms introduced in this thesis provide an alternative to the Costas loop and DLL. The task of tracking the PRN sequences is handled by a single Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The EKF is used to estimate the user’s position in the Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF) coordinate frame. Using the EKF’s estimates, the code phases of the PRN sequences being received from the different satellites are predicted. Estimates of the code phase error between the predicted and received codes are generated using discriminator functions. The estimates of the code phase errors are used to update the EKF’s estimates of the user’s navigation states. To provide proof of concept, data was collected using a Spirent GPS simulator. The recorded data was used to show that the new Kalman filter based algorithms outperform traditional tracking methods. v},

In this paper, based on analyzing the pure geometry and possibility statistics map matching algorithms, a integrated map matching algorithm based on fuzzy logic is proposed by synthesizing the merits of two methods and the topology relation of the real road network, and using the concept of the fuzzy theory.

abstract = {This work presents a method for incorporating GPS (Global Positioning System) and standard roll stability control (RSC) sensors into the electronic stability control (ESC) and RSC systems. It is an adaptation of the very well known loosely-coupled GPS/INS (Inertial Navigation System) integration strategy which has been modified for the purposes of ESC systems. The first modification is the removal of the pitch rate gyroscope, a sensor which is unavailable on commercial vehicles. The second modification deals with the observability problems of the standard loosely coupled filter by adding heading constraints when the ve- hicle is not turning. The structure and algorithm of this method is presented. Observability conditions are evaluated, and the convergence of the estimates are analyzed via simulations. The conclusions from these simulations are compared with the expectations from the lit- erature and observability condition checks. An experiment which illustrates the long term performance of the bias estimation was performed, followed by an experiment showing the roll and sideslip estimation performance during dynamic events. It is shown that over the long term the inertial bias estimates will converge if the vehicle experiences adequate dy- namics, and that the system is able to accurately estimate sideslip and roll during dynamic maneuvers. The system is also able to estimate slow sideslip buildup, an important capabil- ity for ESC systems. The unified system is compared with a less integrated or “modular” approach for both experiments. Furthermore, a method for using GPS to detect tire pressure changes is presented based on the hypothesis that the tire effective radius varies according to tire pressure. A technique using GPS and wheel speed signals to estimate the effective radius of the tires is discussed and validated in simulation and experiment. Experiments are given to show how the ra- dius estimate varies according to tire pressure, and a simple pressure loss detection law is discussed. A method to detect steering misalignment is also presented.},

abstract = {Map-matching algorithms integrate positioning data with spatial road network data (roadway centrelines) to identify the correct link on which a vehicle is travelling and to determine the location of a vehicle on a link. A map-matching algorithm could be used as a key component to improve the performance of systems that support the navigation function of intelligent transport systems (ITS). The required horizontal positioning accuracy of such {\{}ITS{\}} applications is in the range of 1{\&}{\#}xa0;m to 40{\&}{\#}xa0;m (95{\%}) with relatively stringent requirements placed on integrity (quality), continuity and system availability. A number of map-matching algorithms have been developed by researchers around the world using different techniques such as topological analysis of spatial road network data, probabilistic theory, Kalman filter, fuzzy logic, and belief theory. The performances of these algorithms have improved over the years due to the application of advanced techniques in the map matching processes and improvements in the quality of both positioning and spatial road network data. However, these algorithms are not always capable of supporting {\{}ITS{\}} applications with high required navigation performance, especially in difficult and complex environments such as dense urban areas. This suggests that research should be directed at identifying any constraints and limitations of existing map matching algorithms as a prerequisite for the formulation of algorithm improvements. The objectives of this paper are thus to uncover the constraints and limitations by an in-depth literature review and to recommend ideas to address them. This paper also highlights the potential impacts of the forthcoming European Galileo system and the European Geostationary Overlay Service (EGNOS) on the performance of map matching algorithms. Although not addressed in detail, the paper also presents some ideas for monitoring the integrity of map-matching algorithms. The map-matching algorithms considered in this paper are generic and do not assume knowledge of {\^{a}}future{\^{a}} information (i.e. based on either cost or time). Clearly, such data would result in relatively simple map-matching algorithms. },

abstract = {In this thesis, ultra-wideband radios (UWBs) are integrated into the real-time kinematic (RTK) algorithm using differential GPS techniques to achieve a highly precise relative positioning vector between GPS antennas. This has potential applications including an autonomous leader-follower scenario or an unmanned aerial refueling scenario. The UWBs give a range measurement between antennas, while the RTK solution gives a three dimensional relative positioning vector. This UWB range measurement can be integrated into the RTK algorithm to add robustness and increase accuracy. When two GPS receivers are within a close proximity, most of the errors that degrade the GPS signal are correlated between the two receivers and can be mitigated by using differential techniques. This can be done using either a static base station, as is the case for RTK, or using a dynamic base, as is the case for DRTK. These algorithms are explained in detail in this thesis, as well as results showing the improved accuracy. The difficulty of the RTK algorithm is that it must resolve ambiguities in the carrier phase once the receiver has locked on to a satellite’s signal. The least squares ambiguity adjustment (LAMBDA) method was created to help resolve these ambiguities. When the baseline between GPS antennas is known, this known baseline can be used as a constraint and can be integrated into the LAMBDA method, resulting in a C-LAMBDA method. This thesis uses the UWB range measurements in place of the known baseline in the C-LAMBDA method and results showing its improvement over the standard LAMBDA method are presented. By looking at the experimental results, some conclusions can be made. As long as the accuracy of the UWB range measurements is within a few centimeters, it is shown that it can be used in the C-LAMBDA method as the baseline constraint in helping to resolve the carrier phase ambiguities.},

abstract = {In this paper, we provide a straightforward proof of an important, but nevertheless little known, result obtained by Lindley in the framework of subjective probability theory. This result, once interpreted in the machine learning/pattern recognition context, puts new light on the probabilistic interpretation of the output of a trained classifier. A learning machine, or more generally a model, is usually trained by minimizing a criterion-the expectation of the cost function-measuring the discrepancy between the model output and the desired output. In this letter, we first show that, for the binary classification case, training the model with any "reasonable cost function" can lead to Bayesian a posteriori probability estimation. Indeed, after having trained the model by minimizing the criterion, there always exists a computable transformation that maps the output of the model to the Bayesian a posteriori probability of the class membership given the input. Then, necessary conditions allowing the computation of the transformation mapping the outputs of the model to the a posteriori probabilities are derived for the multioutput case. Finally, these theoretical results are illustrated through some simulation examples involving various cost functions.},

abstract = {The global positioning system (GPS) has become the most extensively used positioning and navigation tool in the world. Applications of GPS abound in surveying, mapping, transportation, agriculture, military planning, GIS, and the geosciences. However, the positional and elevation accuracy of any given GPS location is prone to error, due to a number of factors. This has serious implications for some applications, such as real-time navigational systems. GPS accuracy can be significantly improved with additional data, possibly from multiple sources, and especially from multiple receivers. In the case of a single GPS receiver, its position and elevation can be considerably improved with the use of spatial data. For vehicle tracking, map matching can be employed to intelligently snap the GPS location to a road centreline, while height aiding can augment the GPS solution by utilising a digital terrain model (DTM), thereby reducing the number of satellites required to determine a position. This paper describes the use of map matching and height aiding, and examines the effect of different terrain resolutions (Ordnance Survey 1:50,000 and 1:10,000 scale DTMs) on plan position and elevation accuracy for vehicle tracking. Furthermore, the user's choice of interpolation algorithm for estimating heights from the DTM is investigated. The results of the experiments described in this paper demonstrate that height aiding alone reduces the mean error in elevation from 22.5 to 17.5 m for of a single GPS receiver, and the mean error in plan position from 6 to 5 m. However, map matching and height aiding combined, reduces the elevation RMSE of a single GPS receiver from 22.5 m to approximately 4 m (1:50,000 scale DTM) and down to 0.8 m (1:10,000 scale DTM), while the plan position RMSE is reduced from 5.9 to 3.2 m (either DTM). It is also demonstrated that when the number of satellites visible to the receiver is reduced, or the satellite geometry is poor, map matching and height aiding considerably improves the plan and elevation accuracy. The use of a higher-order interpolant (e.g. a bicubic or biquintic polynomial) is shown to slightly improve performance, compared to a bilinear interpolant, for the lower-resolution DTM, but has little overall benefit for the higher resolution DTM. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Many urban navigation applications (e.g., autonomous navigation, driver assistance systems) can benefit greatly from localization with centimeter accuracy. Yet such accuracy cannot be achieved reliably with GPS-based inertial guidance systems, specifically in urban settings. We propose a technique for high-accuracy localization of moving vehicles that utilizes maps of urban environments. Our approach integrates GPS, IMU, wheel odometry, and LIDAR data acquired by an instrumented vehicle, to generate high-resolution environment maps. Offline relaxation techniques similar to recent SLAM methods [2, 10, 13, 14, 21, 30] are employed to bring the map into alignment at intersections and other regions of self-overlap. By reducing the final map to the flat road surface, imprints of other vehicles are removed. The result is a 2-D surface image of ground reflectivity in the infrared spectrum with 5cm pixel resolution. To localize a moving vehicle relative to these maps, we present a particle filter method for correlating LIDAR measurements with this map. As we show by experimentation, the resulting relative accuracies exceed that of conventional GPS-IMU-odometry-based methods by more than an order of magnitude. Specifically, we show that our algorithm is effective in urban environments, achieving reliable real-time localization with accuracy in the 10-centimeter range. Experimental results are provided for localization in GPS-denied environments, during bad weather, and in dense traffic.},

In some scenarios, however, this is considered to be inadequate. It has been shown that in this case, a particle filter can give better performance. Such a filter, the variable-structure multiple-model particle filter (VS-MMPF), is given in the literature. In this paper we present a new approach to solving the GMTI tracking problem using a particle filter. We have developed an unscented particle filter, where the particles model the uncertainty over the motion model while, conditional upon the model, the target state is modelled using an unscented Kalman filter. Simulation results show that the UPF-based filter gives performance similar to the VS-MMPF with significantly fewer particles and better results than the standard VS-IMM approach.},

Assuming vehicles are equipped with proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors (with biases) to cooperatively localize positions, a simultaneous solution for joint spatial registration and state estimation is proposed. For this, we rely on the sequential Monte Carlo implementation of the PHD filtering. Compared to other methods, the concept of multiple vehicle cooperative localization with spatial registration is first proposed under Random Finite Set Theory. In addition, the proposed solution also addresses the challenges for multiple vehicle cooperative localization, e.g., the communication bandwidth issue and data association uncertainty.

abstract = {Over the last 20-30 years, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) has
become the algorithm of choice in numerous nonlinear estimation and
machine learning applications. These include estimating the state of a
nonlinear dynamic system as well estimating parameters for nonlinear
system identification (eg, learning the weights of a neural network).
The EKF applies the standard linear Kalman filter methodology to a
linearization of the true nonlinear system. This approach is
sub-optimal, and can easily lead to divergence. Julier et al. (1997),
proposed the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) as a derivative-free
alternative to the extended Kalman filter in the framework of state
estimation. This was extended to parameter estimation by Wan and Van der
Merwe et al., (2000). The UKF consistently outperforms the EKF in terms
of prediction and estimation error, at an equal computational complexity
of (OL<sup>3</sup>)<sup>l</sup> for general state-space problems. When
the EKF is applied to parameter estimation, the special form of the
state-space equations allows for an O(L<sup>2</sup>) implementation.
This paper introduces the square-root unscented Kalman filter (SR-UKF)
which is also O(L<sup>3</sup>) for general state estimation and
O(L<sup>2</sup>) for parameter estimation (note the original formulation
of the UKF for parameter-estimation was O(L<sup>3</sup>)). In addition,
the square-root forms have the added benefit of numerical stability and
guaranteed positive semi-definiteness of the state covariances},

In this letter, we find that under the condition of n+{\&}amp;kappa;=const, the basic difference between them is that the augmented UKF draws a sigma set only once within a filtering recursion, while the nonaugmented UKF has to redraw a new set of sigma points to incorporate the effect of additive process noise. This difference generally favors the augmented UKF in that the odd-order moment information is partly captured by the nonlinearly transformed sigma points and propagated throughout the recursion.

abstract = {Map-matching (MM) algorithms integrate positioning data from a Global Positioning System (or a number of other positioning sensors) with a spatial road map with the aim of identifying the road segment on which a user (or a vehicle) is travelling and the location on that segment. Amongst the family of MM algorithms consisting of geometric, topological, probabilistic and advanced, topological MM (tMM) algorithms are relatively simple, easy and quick, enabling them to be implemented in real-time. Therefore, a tMM algorithm is used in many navigation devices manufactured by industry. However, existing tMM algorithms have a number of limitations which affect their performance relative to advanced MM algorithms. This paper demonstrates that it is possible by addressing these issues to significantly improve the performance of a tMM algorithm. This paper describes the development of an enhanced weight-based tMM algorithm in which the weights are determined from real-world field data using an optimisation technique. Two new weights for turn-restriction at junctions and link connectivity are introduced to improve the performance of matching, especially at junctions. A new procedure is developed for the initial map-matching process. Two consistency checks are introduced to minimise mismatches. The enhanced map-matching algorithm was tested using field data from dense urban areas and suburban areas. The algorithm identified 96.8{\%} and 95.93{\%} of the links correctly for positioning data collected in urban areas of central London and Washington, DC, respectively. In case of suburban area, in the west of London, the algorithm succeeded with 96.71{\%} correct link identification with a horizontal accuracy of 9.81 m (2??). This is superior to most existing topological MM algorithms and has the potential to support the navigation modules of many Intelligent Transport System (ITS) services. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Electrical microstimulation has been used to elucidate cortical function. This review discusses neuronal excitability and effective current spread estimated by using three different methods: 1) single-cell recording, 2) behavioral methods, and 3) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The excitability properties of the stimulated elements in neocortex obtained using these methods were found to be comparable. These properties suggested that microstimulation activates the most excitable elements in cortex, that is, by and large the fibers of the pyramidal cells. Effective current spread within neocortex was found to be greater when measured with fMRI compared with measures based on single-cell recording or behavioral methods. The spread of activity based on behavioral methods is in close agreement with the spread based on the direct activation of neurons (as opposed to those activated synaptically). We argue that the greater activation with imaging is attributed to transynaptic spread, which includes subthreshold activation of sites connected to the site of stimulation. The definition of effective current spread therefore depends on the neural event being measured.},

abstract = {The satellite-based vehicle tracking system accuracy can be improved by augmenting the positional information using road network data, in a process known as map-matching. Map-matching algorithms attempt to pinpoint the vehicle in a particular road map segment (or any restricting track such as rails, etc), in spite of the digital map errors and navigation system inaccuracies. Point-to-curve matching algorithm is not suitable to the problem since it ignores any historical data and often gave unstable, jumping results. The better curve-to-curve matching algorithms considers the road connectivity and measure the similarity between track and the possible road path (hypotheses), but mostly does not have any way to manage multiple track hypotheses which have varying degree of similarity over time. The paper presents a new similarity metric for curve-to-curve map-matching technique, combined with the ability to maintain many possible road hypotheses and picks the most likely hypothesis at a time, enabling future corrections if necessary, therefore providing intelligent guesses with considerable accuracy.},

abstract = {This thesis documents the development of algorithms for an inertial navigation system (INS). In general, inertial navigation consists of three parts: Alignment, navigation and aiding. Algorithms for these parts are derived in this thesis. In order to create reproducable test data for verifi- cation and analysis of the algorithms, an earth simu- lation model is developed. The algorithms were also tested against a reference INS, a Kearfott T16 INS, to verify that the algorithms also work on real-world data with real noise sources. The navigation equations needed for an INS for ter- restrial navigation are developed and tested against the reference INS. Tests showed that the developed navigation equations were able to follow the reference trajectory to a satisfactory degree, thus validating the navigation equations. The alignment algorithms make use of an indirect Kalman filter, which estimates the errors in the INS states. For this, an error model is developed, which describes the propagation of errors within the INS. An alignment algorithm is developed to estimate tilt and heading of the system. The alignment algorithm was verified against data from the reference system, and was shown to be able to estimate tilt and heading to a satisfactory degree. Algorithms for aiding the INS navigation equations were developed for a speedometer and a GPS. These algorithms also use the indirect Kalman filter and the error model. Using data from the reference system together with GPS measurements, it was shown that the developed algorithms were able to aid the naviga- tion equations and produce better results than either of the systems in a standalone setup. It was also shown that the INS was able to track position during GPS outages.},

This method provides an accurate estimation of position for a vehicle relative to a digital road map using Belief Theory and Kalman filtering. Firstly, an Extended Kalman Filter combines the DGPS and ABS sensor measurements to produce an approximation of the vehicle's pose, which is then used to select the most likely segment from the database. The particular attention given to the modeling of the system showed that incrementing the state by the bias (also called absolute error) of the map significantly increases the performance of the method. Real experimental results show that this approach, if correctly initialized, is able to work over a substantial period without GPS.},

abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as GPS and digital road maps can be used for land vehicle navigation systems. However, GPS requires a level of augmentation with other navigation sensors and systems such as Dead Reckoning (DR) devices, in order to achieve the required navigation performance (RNP) in some areas such as urban canyons, streets with dense tree cover, and tunnels. One of the common solutions is to integrate GPS with DR by employing a Kalman Filter (Zhao et al., 2003). The integrated navigation systems usually rely on various types of sensors. Even with very good sensor calibration and sensor fusion technologies, inaccuracies in the positioning sensors are often inevitable. There are also errors associated with spatial road network data. This paper develops an improved probabilistic Map Matching (MM) algorithm to reconcile inaccurate locational data with inaccurate digital road network data. The basic characteristics of the algorithm take into account the error sources associated with the positioning sensors, the historical trajectory of the vehicle, topological information on the road network (e.g., connectivity and orientation of links), and the heading and speed information of the vehicle. This then enables a precise identification of the correct link on which the vehicle is travelling. An optimal estimation technique to determine the vehicle position on the link has also been developed and is described. Positioning data was obtained from a comprehensive field test carried out in Central London. The algorithm was tested on a complex urban road network with a high resolution digital road map. The performance of the algorithm was found to be very good for different traffic manoeuvres and a significant improvement over using just an integrated GPS/DR solution.},

@article{Wan2000,
abstract = {This paper points out the flaws in using the extended Kalman
filter (EKE) and introduces an improvement, the unscented Kalman filter
(UKF), proposed by Julier and Uhlman (1997). A central and vital
operation performed in the Kalman filter is the propagation of a
Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics. In the EKF
the state distribution is approximated by a GRV, which is then
propagated analytically through the first-order linearization of the
nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the true posterior
mean and covariance of the transformed GRV, which may lead to
sub-optimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter. The UKF
addresses this problem by using a deterministic sampling approach. The
state distribution is again approximated by a GRV, but is now
represented using a minimal set of carefully chosen sample points. These
sample points completely capture the true mean and covariance of the
GRV, and when propagated through the true nonlinear system, captures the
posterior mean and covariance accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series
expansion) for any nonlinearity. The EKF in contrast, only achieves
first-order accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the
UKF is the same order as that of the EKF. Julier and Uhlman demonstrated
the substantial performance gains of the UKF in the context of
state-estimation for nonlinear control. Machine learning problems were
not considered. We extend the use of the UKF to a broader class of
nonlinear estimation problems, including nonlinear system
identification, training of neural networks, and dual estimation
problems. In this paper, the algorithms are further developed and
illustrated with a number of additional examples},

abstract = {Vehicle tracking data is an essential "raw" material for a broad range of applications such as traffic management and control, routing, and navigation. An important issue with this data is its accuracy. The method of sampling vehicular movement using GPS is affected by two error sources and consequently produces inaccurate trajectory data. To become useful, the data has to be related to the underlying road network by means of map matching algorithms. We present three such algorithms that consider especially the trajectory nature of the data rather than simply the current position as in the typical map-matching case. An incremental algorithm is proposed that matches consecutive portions of the trajectory to the road network, effectively trading accuracy for speed of computation. In contrast, the two global algorithms compare the entire trajectory to candidate paths in the road network. The algorithms are evaluated in terms of (i) their running time and (ii) the quality of their matching result. Two novel quality measures utilizing the Fr{\'{e}}chet distance are introduced and subsequently used in an experimental evaluation to assess the quality of matching real tracking data to a road network.},

The significant growth of sensing, communication and computing capabilities over the recent years has opened new fields of applications, such as ADAS and active safety systems, and has brought the ability of exchanging information between vehicles. In this paper, a new method for improving vehicle positioning is proposed. This method is a decentralized method based on sharing GPS data and inter-vehicular distance measurements within a cluster of vehicles. A Bayesian approach is used to fuse the GPS data and inter-vehicular distances. In order to investigate the performance of this new approach on vehicle localization, a Kalman filter has been employed to incorporate the dynamics of the vehicle. The effect of this method on the reduction of the localization uncertainty, over-convergence issues and identification of the vehicles are also discussed in this paper.},

The HMM elegantly accounts for measurement noise and the layout of the road network. We test our algorithm on ground truth data collected from a GPS receiver in a vehicle. Our test shows how the algorithm breaks down as the sampling rate of the GPS is reduced. We also test the effect of increasing amounts of additional measurement noise in order to assess how well our algorithm could deal with the inaccuracies of other location measurement systems, such as those based on WiFi and cell tower multilateration. We provide our GPS data and road network representation as a standard test set for other researchers to use in their map matching work.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new method to optimally combine motion measurements provided by proprioceptive sensors, with relative-state estimates inferred from feature-based matching. Two key challenges arise in such pose tracking problems: 1) the displacement estimates relate the state of the robot at two different time instants and 2) the same exteroceptive measurements are often used for computing consecutive displacement estimates, a process that renders the errors in these correlated. We present a novel stochastic cloning Kalman filtering (SC-KF) estimation algorithm that successfully addresses these challenges, while still allowing for efficient calculation of the filter gains and covariances. The proposed algorithm is not intended to compete with simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approaches. Instead, it can be merged with any extended-Kalman- filter-based SLAM algorithm to increase its precision. In this respect, the SC-KF provides a robust framework for leveraging additional motion information extracted from dense point features that most SLAM algorithms do not treat as landmarks. Extensive experimental and simulation results are presented to verify the validity of the proposed method and to demonstrate that its performance is superior to that of alternative position-tracking approaches.},

and therefore it follows that any measurement not falling within this
domain is clearly affected by measurement noise. The authors have
previously developed an estimator for translating position measurements
onto a road thereby removing a component of the measurement noise. This
work is now extended to cover the translation of velocity measurements
and the joint estimation of position and velocity. Further to this the
problem of applying the estimator to a complete road network has been
analyzed. A Kalman filter, referred to as the spatially reduced Kalman
filter (SRKF), has been developed to utilise the reduced dimensionality
of the translated data. For each possible trajectory through the road
network, an SRKF is initialised and updated. Target-tracking techniques
have been adapted to enable the best trajectory at any given time to be
selected and poor trajectories to be deleted. The result is an
estimation process that results in better accuracy and effective road
identification},

We present efficient simulation-based algorithms called particle filters to solve the optimal filtering problem as well as the optimal fixed-lag smoothing problem. Our algorithms combine sequential importance sampling, a selection scheme, and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. They use several variance reduction methods to make the most of the statistical structure of JMLS. Computer simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. The problems of on-line deconvolution of impulsive processes and of tracking a maneuvering target are considered. It is shown that our algorithms outperform the current methods},

abstract = { This paper describes a generalisation of the unscented transformation (UT) which allows sigma points to be scaled to an arbitrary dimension. The UT is a method for predicting means and covariances in nonlinear systems. A set of samples are deterministically chosen which match the mean and covariance of a (not necessarily Gaussian-distributed) probability distribution. These samples can be scaled by an arbitrary constant. The method guarantees that the mean and covariance second order accuracy in mean and covariance, giving the same performance as a second order truncated filter but without the need to calculate any Jacobians or Hessians. The impacts of scaling issues are illustrated by considering conversions from polar to Cartesian coordinates with large angular uncertainties.},

abstract = {This thesis documents the development of algorithms for an inertial navigation system (INS). In general, inertial navigation consists of three parts: Alignment, navigation and aiding. Algorithms for these parts are derived in this thesis. In order to create reproducable test data for verifi- cation and analysis of the algorithms, an earth simu- lation model is developed. The algorithms were also tested against a reference INS, a Kearfott T16 INS, to verify that the algorithms also work on real-world data with real noise sources. The navigation equations needed for an INS for ter- restrial navigation are developed and tested against the reference INS. Tests showed that the developed navigation equations were able to follow the reference trajectory to a satisfactory degree, thus validating the navigation equations. The alignment algorithms make use of an indirect Kalman filter, which estimates the errors in the INS states. For this, an error model is developed, which describes the propagation of errors within the INS. An alignment algorithm is developed to estimate tilt and heading of the system. The alignment algorithm was verified against data from the reference system, and was shown to be able to estimate tilt and heading to a satisfactory degree. Algorithms for aiding the INS navigation equations were developed for a speedometer and a GPS. These algorithms also use the indirect Kalman filter and the error model. Using data from the reference system together with GPS measurements, it was shown that the developed algorithms were able to aid the naviga- tion equations and produce better results than either of the systems in a standalone setup. It was also shown that the INS was able to track position during GPS outages.},

This approach has led to important progress in engineering physics. Nevertheless, a systemic approach is useful in physics and irreplaceable for living systems. This second way uses global laws of the phenomenon in addition with a dynamical identification of the system using some adequate experiments.

hypothesis technique (MHT) to determine a road in probabilistic
approach. The MHT is a method to track multiple targets under the
clutter environment using a likelihood function. To realize a map
matching method using the MHT, pseudo-measurements are generated
utilizing adjacent roads of GPS position and the MHT is reformulated as
a single target problem. Since pseudo-measurements are generated using
digital maps, topological properties such as road connection, direction,
and road facility information can be considered by calculating the
probabilities of hypotheses. In order to reduce the degradation of the
map matching performance by bias errors in the road data in digital
maps, a Kalman filter is employed to estimate the bias. Field
experimental results show that the proposed map matching method provides
a consistent performance even in complex downtown areas,
overpass/underpass areas, and in the areas that roads are adjacent in

A four layers AFNN was designed based on if-then rule set, the convergent learning rule is fetched for the AFNN.

abstract = {In this thesis several new Kalman filter based tracking algorithms for GPS software receivers are presented. Traditional receivers use Costas loops and Delay Lock Loops (DLL) to track the carrier and Pseudo-Random Noise (PRN) signals broadcast by the GPS satellites, respectively. The tasks of tracking the the carrier and PRN signals are done separately. The Kalman filter based algorithms introduced in this thesis provide an alternative to the Costas loop and DLL. The task of tracking the PRN sequences is handled by a single Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The EKF is used to estimate the user’s position in the Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF) coordinate frame. Using the EKF’s estimates, the code phases of the PRN sequences being received from the different satellites are predicted. Estimates of the code phase error between the predicted and received codes are generated using discriminator functions. The estimates of the code phase errors are used to update the EKF’s estimates of the user’s navigation states. To provide proof of concept, data was collected using a Spirent GPS simulator. The recorded data was used to show that the new Kalman filter based algorithms outperform traditional tracking methods. v},

abstract = {This work presents a method for incorporating GPS (Global Positioning System) and standard roll stability control (RSC) sensors into the electronic stability control (ESC) and RSC systems. It is an adaptation of the very well known loosely-coupled GPS/INS (Inertial Navigation System) integration strategy which has been modified for the purposes of ESC systems. The first modification is the removal of the pitch rate gyroscope, a sensor which is unavailable on commercial vehicles. The second modification deals with the observability problems of the standard loosely coupled filter by adding heading constraints when the ve- hicle is not turning. The structure and algorithm of this method is presented. Observability conditions are evaluated, and the convergence of the estimates are analyzed via simulations. The conclusions from these simulations are compared with the expectations from the lit- erature and observability condition checks. An experiment which illustrates the long term performance of the bias estimation was performed, followed by an experiment showing the roll and sideslip estimation performance during dynamic events. It is shown that over the long term the inertial bias estimates will converge if the vehicle experiences adequate dy- namics, and that the system is able to accurately estimate sideslip and roll during dynamic maneuvers. The system is also able to estimate slow sideslip buildup, an important capabil- ity for ESC systems. The unified system is compared with a less integrated or “modular” approach for both experiments. Furthermore, a method for using GPS to detect tire pressure changes is presented based on the hypothesis that the tire effective radius varies according to tire pressure. A technique using GPS and wheel speed signals to estimate the effective radius of the tires is discussed and validated in simulation and experiment. Experiments are given to show how the ra- dius estimate varies according to tire pressure, and a simple pressure loss detection law is discussed. A method to detect steering misalignment is also presented.},

abstract = {This thesis deals with the problem of detecting faults in an environment where the mea- surements are affected by additive noise. To do this, a residual sensitive to faults is derived and statistical methods are used to distinguish faults from noise. Standard methods for fault detection compare a batch of data with a model of the system using the generalized likelihood ratio. Careful treatment of the initial state of the model is quite important, in particular for short batch sizes. One method to handle this is the parity-space method which solves the problemby removing the influence of the initial state using a projection. In this thesis, the case where prior knowledge about the initial state is available is treated. This can be obtained for example from a K a l m a n fi l t e r . Combining the prior estimate with a minimum variance estimate from the data batch results in a smoothed estimate. The influence of the estimated initial state is then removed. It is also shown that removing the influence of the initial state by an estimate fromthe data batch will result in the parity-space method. To model slowly changing faults, an efficient parameterization using Chebyshev polynomials is given. The methods described above have been applied to an I n e r t i a l M e a s u r e m e n t U n i t , IMU. The IMU usually consists of accelerometers and gyroscopes, but has in this work been extendedwith a magnetometer. Traditionally, the IMU has been used to estimate po- sition and orientation of airplanes,missiles etc. Recently, the size and cost has decreased making it possible to use IMU:s for applications such as augmented reality and body mo- tion analysis. Since a magnetometer is very sensitive to disturbances from metal, such disturbances have to be detected. Detection of the disturbancesmakes compensation pos- sible. Another topic covered is the fundamental question of observability for fault inputs. Given a fixed or linearly growing fault, conditions for observability are given. Themeasurements fromthe IMU showthat the noise distribution of the sensors can be well approximated with white Gaussian noise. This gives good correspondence between practical and theoretical results when the sensor is kept at rest. The disturbances for the IMU can be approximated using smooth functions with respect to time. Low rank parameterizations can therefore be used to describe the disturbances. The results show that the use of smoothing to obtain the initial state estimate and parameterization of the disturbances improves the detection performance drastically.},

abstract = {In recent years, the use of digital map data with road attributes has spread from in- vehicle navigation systems to more sophisticated driver assistance systems. The data can be used together with a GPS positioning system to provide information about the road network close to the vehicle. The information is sufficient for navigation purposes but for the advanced applications, a more accurate model of the road ahead is needed. This thesis proposes a method for road modelling from commercially available map data using a spline interpolation algorithm. The algorithm has several features, such as a possibility to change the smoothness of the spline and to model intersections and right-hand traffic. The road models can be used in applications where a preview of the road shape is of interest. An example application is also developed; a map supported cruise control. The map supported cruise control uses speed limits and road curvature calculated from the model to automatically adjust the target speed of the cruise control before sharp turns and changes in speed limits. A vehicle model is used to predict the deceleration, which in turn is used to decide when to lower the target speed. The road models are verified against collected GPS-data and it is shown that the models provide better fit to road shape and curvature, compared with the source map data. The improvement is most obvious in sharp curves and intersections. The models were also implemented in a test truck. On-road tests enabled comparison of the driver’s speed with the recommended maximum speed calculated from the road models. The tests showed that the developed models are accurate enough to be used for automatic speed adaption. The on-road tests also showed that the map database environment used has to be improved. For example, speed limits are often missing in the map data and errors were found in the position mapping. The map supported cruise control worked well in the few test drives conducted. To improve and expand its use the brakes of the truck must be utilised. Unfortunately, this was not achieved in this study. The final conclusion is that the concept, or a simplified version of it, is promising and might be considered as a feature in future trucks.},

abstract = { The problem of tracking ground targets with GMTI sensors has received some attention in the recent past. In addition to standard GMTI sensor measurements, one is interested in using non-standard information such as road maps, and terrain-related visibility conditions to enhance tracker performance. The conventional approach to this problem has been to use the variable structure IMM (VS-IMM), which uses the concept of directional process noise to model motion along particular roads. In this paper, we present a particle filter based approach to this problem which we call variable structure multiple model particle filter (VS-MMPF). Simulation results show that the performance of the VS-MMPF is much superior to that of VS-IMM.},

abstract = {Map-matching is the process of aligning a sequence of observed user positions with the road network on a digital map. It is a fundamental pre-processing step for many applications, such as moving object management, traffic flow analysis, and driving directions. In practice there exists huge amount of low-sampling-rate (e.g., one point every 2--5 minutes) GPS trajectories. Unfortunately, most current map-matching approaches only deal with high-sampling-rate (typically one point every 10--30s) GPS data, and become less effective for low-sampling-rate points as the uncertainty in data increases. In this paper, we propose a novel global map-matching algorithm called ST-Matching for low-sampling-rate GPS trajectories. ST-Matching considers (1) the spatial geometric and topological structures of the road network and (2) the temporal/speed constraints of the trajectories. Based on spatio-temporal analysis, a candidate graph is constructed from which the best matching path sequence is identified. We compare ST-Matching with the incremental algorithm and Average-Fr{\'{e}}chet-Distance (AFD) based global map-matching algorithm. The experiments are performed both on synthetic and real dataset. The results show that our ST-matching algorithm significantly outperform incremental algorithm in terms of matching accuracy for low-sampling trajectories. Meanwhile, when compared with AFD-based global algorithm, ST-Matching also improves accuracy as well as running time.},

First, it uses all available local observations including the most recent ones in deriving the proposal distribution. Second, computation of global estimates from local estimates during the consensus step is based on an optimal fusion rule.

Illustrative examples are given using a second-order linear-Gaussian model for vehicle road speed. The value of road map data is shown via a tracking example with poor quality measurements and a substantial period prior to sensor activation. The tracking algorithm is implemented using a standard particle filter. In particular, the scheme has potential for revealing the likely paths taken by the vehicle.},

abstract = {Tracking ground targets with airborne GMTI (ground moving target indicator) sensor measurements proves to be a challenging task due to high target density, high clutter, and low visibility. The exploitation of nonstandard background information such as road maps and terrain information is therefore highly desirable for the enhancement of track quality and track continuity. The present paper presents a Bayesian approach to incorporate such information consistently. It is particularly suited to deal with winding roads and networks of roads. The target dynamics is modeled in quasi one-dimensional road coordinates and mapped onto ground coordinates using linear road segments taking road map errors into account. The case of several intersecting roads with different characteristics, such as mean curvature, slope, or visibility, is treated within an interacting multiple model (IMM) scheme. Targets can be masked both by the clutter notch of the sensor and by terrain obstacles. Both effects are modeled using a sensor-target state dependent detection probability. The iterative filter equations are formulated within a framework of Gaussian sum approximations on the one hand and a particle filter approach on the other hand. Simulation results for single targets taken from a realistic ground scenario show strongly reduced target location errors compared with the case of neglecting road-map information. By modeling the clutter notch of the GMTI sensor, early detection of stopping targets is demonstrated},

Several estimation methods have been proposed to handle the multi-modality that arise in a road target tracking application. One popular filter suitable for this kind of non-linear problems is the particle filter, but a major drawback is that the particle filter requires a large amount of particles as the state dimension increases to maintain a good approximation of the filtering distribution. In this paper a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter based approach is proposed to reduce the dimension of the state space in road target tracking applications. Furthermore, it is also shown how prior information about the probability of detection can be used to improve the estimation performance further.},

This is due particularly to the environment with a high density road traffic, terrain masks... etc, and to the high manoeuverability of ground targets. In this paper, the tracking of a manoeuvring ground target on a road in a cluttered environment is studied using map information to enhance the tracking quality. Based on road segments positions, dynamic models under road constraints are built and an optimized projection technique of the estimated state is proposed in order to keep the target position and heading on the road. Using this projection approach, a multiple model tracking algorithm is derived and its performances are studied. The derived filter is an IMM (interacting multiple model) filter with a variable structure (VS-IMM) where the models set adapts sequentially according to the target position and to the road network configuration.},

abstract = {For professional users such as firefighters and other first responders, GNSS positioning technology (GPS, assisted GPS) can satisfy outdoor positioning requirements in many instances. However, there is still a need for high-performance deep indoor positioning for use by these same professional users. This need has already been clearly expressed by various communities of end users in the context of WearIT@Work, an R{\&}amp;amp;D project funded by the European Community's Sixth Framework Program. It is known that map matching can help for indoor pedestrian navigation. In most previous research, it was assumed that detailed building plans are available. However, in many emergency / rescue scenarios, only very limited building plan information may be at hand. For example a building outline might be obtained from aerial photographs or cataster databases. Alternatively, an escape plan posted at the entrances to many building would yield only approximate exit door and stairwell locations as well as hallway and room orientation. What is not known is how much map information is really required for a USAR mission and how much each level of map detail might help to improve positioning accuracy. Obviously, the geometry of the building and the course through will be factors consider. The purpose of this paper is to show how a previously published Backtracking Particle Filter (BPF) can be combined with different levels of building plan detail to improve PDR performance. A new in/out scenario that might be typical of a reconnaissance mission during a fire in a two-story office building was evaluated. Using only external wall information, the new scenario yields positioning performance (2.56 m mean 2D error) that is greatly superior to the PDR-only, no map base case (7.74 m mean 2D error). This result has a substantial practical significance since this level of building plan detail could be quickly and easily generated in many emergency instances. The technique could be used to mitigate-

 heading errors that result from exposing the IMU to extreme operating conditions. It is hoped that this mitigating effect will also occur for more irregular paths and in larger traversed spaces such as parking garages and warehouses.},

The resulting algorithm is referred to as feedback particle filter. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comparative study of the feedback particle filter (FPF). Two types of comparisons are discussed: i) with the extended Kalman filter, and ii) with the conventional resampling-based particle filters. The comparison with Kalman filter is used to highlight the feedback structure of the FPF. Also computational cost estimates are discussed, in terms of number of operations relative to EKF. Comparison with the conventional particle filtering approaches is based on a numerical example taken from the survey article on the topic of nonlinear filtering [2]. Comparisons are provided for both computational cost and accuracy. A secondary purpose of this paper is to provide a summary of the FPF algorithm, that can aid practitioners to rapidly implement the algorithm.

abstract = {To track a vehicle using GPS data, map matching is not only to select the map feature that the vehicle was at a GPS point, but also to find out the route it traveled. For GPS data at high polling rate, it is very obvious that the vehicle stays on the same map feature or a map feature directly connected with the previous GPS point. For low polling rates, a map feature where a vehicle is at a GPS point, is not always directly connected with the map feature where the vehicle is at the previous GPS point. In this paper, an improved model is proposed. The candidate set generation considers the difference of the width of links, and the matched map feature selection considers the length of the route, the difference between the azimuth of the GPS point and the map feature and the deviation of the raw GPS position to the candidate map feature. A field test shows that the improved model performs better than the previous model.},

abstract = {In this paper we present the design of a Variable Structure
Interacting Multiple Model (VS-IMM) estimator for tracking groups of
ground targets on constrained paths using Moving Target Indicator (MTI)
reports obtained from an airborne sensor. The targets are moving along a
highway, with varying obscuration due to changing terrain conditions. In
addition, the roads can branch, merge or cross-the scenario represents
target convoys along a realistic road network with junctions, changing
terrains, etc. Some of the targets may also move in an open field. This
constrained motion estimation problem is handled using an IMM estimator
with varying mode sets depending on the topography, The number of models
in the IMM estimator, their types and their parameters are modified
adaptively, in real-time, based on the estimated position of the target
and the corresponding road/visibility conditions. This topography-based
variable structure mechanism eliminates the need for carrying all the
possible models throughout the entire tracking period as in the standard
IMM estimator, significantly improving performance and reducing
computational load. Data association is handled using an assignment
algorithm. The estimator is designed to handle a very large number of
ground targets simultaneously. A simulated scenario consisting of over
one hundred targets is used to illustrate the selection of design
parameters and the operation of the tracker. Performance measures are
presented to contrast the benefits of the VS-IMM estimator over the
Kalman filter and the standard IMM estimator, The VS-IMM estimator is
then combined with multidimensional assignment to gain
{\&}amp;ldquo;time-depth.{\&}amp;rdquo; The additional benefit of using higher
dimensional assignment algorithms for data association is also evaluated

However, because of the unknown GPS noise, the estimated position has an undesirable error. To solve this problem, a novel map matching method based on adaptive fuzzy-neural network (AFNN) is proposed in the paper, two important parameters are selected as the networks input signal, such as the projection distance from positioning point to candidate road and the comparability between positioning trajectory and candidate road. A four layers AFNN was designed based on if-then rule set, the convergent learning rule is fetched for the AFNN. Some experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has very good performance for matching the position of car to correct road under normal traffic conditions.},

abstract = {For analyzing dynamic scenarios with many ground moving vehicles, airborne Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) radar is well-suited due to its wide-area, all-weather, day/night, and real time capabilities. The generation of GMTI tracks from these data is the backbone for ground surveillance and traffic flow analysis. In case of dense target situations, missing detections and false alarms, Multi-Hypotheses Tracking (MHT) is the method at choice to solve the inherent ambiguities in the data-targets assignment problem. The resulting MHT-tracks are suited to extract road map information which is highly up-to-date and fairly precise. Moreover, their accuracy is quantitatively described. The precision of the extracted road segments can be improved significantly using smoothed or retrodicted tracks. In turn, the extracted road information is exploited for the precise tracking of succeeding road targets. The proposed, fully Bayesian approach is illustrated by a simulated example including Doppler and terrain obscuration, providing hints to the achievable road map accuracies. © 2006.},

For targets on road, their interaction with the environment and with each other particularly at intersections is more structured, thus useful to tracking algorithms. Indeed, the knowledge of terrain database and road maps can be used as constraints and incorporated into the tracking algorithms. In this paper, we set forth a nonlinear formulation of tracking multiple interacting targets along road networks and apply nonlinear filtering techniques (namely, the extended Kalman filter, the unscented Kalman filter, the particle filter, and a hybrid Kalman particle filter) to the problem for such scenarios as air-to-ground surveillance. Simulation results are present to illustrate the performance of the nonlinear filters with the nonlinear formulation as compared to conventional ones.},

abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of tracking targets, which can move both on-road and off-road, with particle filters utilizing the road-network information. It is argued that the constraints like speed-limits and/or one-way roads generally incorporated into on-road motion models make it necessary to consider additional high-bandwidth off-road motion models. This is true even if the targets under consideration are only allowed to move on-road due to the possibility of imperfect road-map information and drivers violating the traffic rules. The particle filters currently used struggles during sharp mode transitions, with poor estimation quality as a result. This is due to the fact the number of particles allocated to each motion mode is varying according to the mode probabilities. A recently proposed interacting multiple model (IMM) particle filtering algorithm, which keeps the number of particles in each mode constant irrespective of the mode probabilities, is applied to this problem and its performance is compared to a previously existing algorithm. The results of the simulations on a challenging bearing-only tracking scenario show that the proposed algorithm, unlike the previously existing algorithm, can achieve good performance even under the sharpest mode transitions.},

Map-matching algorithms attempt to pinpoint the vehicle in a particular road map segment (or any restricting track such as rails, etc), in spite of the digital map errors and navigation system inaccuracies. Point-to-curve matching algorithm is not suitable to the problem since it ignores any historical data and often gave unstable, jumping results. The better curve-to-curve matching algorithms considers the road connectivity and measure the similarity between track and the possible road path (hypotheses), but mostly does not have any way to manage multiple track hypotheses which have varying degree of similarity over time. The paper presents a new similarity metric for curve-to-curve map-matching technique, combined with the ability to maintain many possible road hypotheses and picks the most likely hypothesis at a time, enabling future corrections if necessary, therefore providing intelligent guesses with considerable accuracy.},

Moreover, it is typically crucial to process data on-line as it arrives, both from the point of view of storage costs as well as for rapid adaptation to changing signal characteristics. In this paper, we review both optimal and suboptimal Bayesian algorithms for nonlinear/non-Gaussian tracking problems, with a focus on particle filters. Particle filters are sequential Monte Carlo methods based on point mass (or "particle") representations of probability densities, which can be applied to any state-space model and which generalize the traditional Kalman filtering methods. Several variants of the particle filter such as SIR, ASIR, and RPF are introduced within a generic framework of the sequential importance sampling (SIS) algorithm. These are discussed and compared with the standard EKF through an illustrative example},

abstract = {Map-matching refers to the process of projecting positioning measurements to a location on a digital road network map. It is an important element of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) focusing on driver assistance applications, on emergency and incident management, arterial and freeway management, and other applications. This paper addresses the problem of map-matching in the applications characterized by imperfect map quality and restricted computational resources - e.g. in the context of community-based ITS applications. Whereas a number of map-matching methods are available, often these methods rely on topological analysis, thereby making them sensitive to the map inaccuracies. In the paper, a new map-matching method based on the probabilistic approach is introduced. In the method, the probabilities of alternative road links are estimated with recursive Bayesian estimation, and the road link is identified using maximum a posteriori probability principle. The topological analysis is not used; instead, the distance between projections on road links is used to assign road link switching probability. The accuracy of the method is empirically evaluated, and the link identification accuracy is found to be similar to that of alternative approaches relying on topological analysis.},

abstract = {The purpose of the map-matching module of an in-vehicle navigation system is to locate the position of the vehicle relative to the map data that is referenced by the system. Map-matching allows the display module to accurately depict to the driver the position of the vehicle on the map, facilitates operations such as route calculation, supports ADAS applications such as adaptive cruise control (ACC) and is required for the ultimate goal of intelligent vehicle research, viz., autonomous driving. The basic approach is to compare the historical vehicular path to possible candidate paths on the map, where candidate paths are the paths on the map which lie within the general vicinity of the vehicle at any instant in time. The candidate map path which best matches the vehicle path is the most likely path on which the vehicle is located. This paper presents two novel metrics, the spatial angle variation metric and the iterative multiresolution trend metric, which provide new methods for two dimensional and three-dimensional map-matching respectively. The methods described here are effective while being both intuitive and computationally non-intensive and provide new insight into the problem of map-matching.},

abstract = {Map-matching algorithms integrate positioning data with spatial road network data (roadway centrelines) to identify the correct link on which a vehicle is travelling and to determine the location of a vehicle on a link. A map-matching algorithm could be used as a key component to improve the performance of systems that support the navigation function of intelligent transport systems (ITS). The required horizontal positioning accuracy of such {\{}ITS{\}} applications is in the range of 1{\&}{\#}xa0;m to 40{\&}{\#}xa0;m (95{\%}) with relatively stringent requirements placed on integrity (quality), continuity and system availability. A number of map-matching algorithms have been developed by researchers around the world using different techniques such as topological analysis of spatial road network data, probabilistic theory, Kalman filter, fuzzy logic, and belief theory. The performances of these algorithms have improved over the years due to the application of advanced techniques in the map matching processes and improvements in the quality of both positioning and spatial road network data. However, these algorithms are not always capable of supporting {\{}ITS{\}} applications with high required navigation performance, especially in difficult and complex environments such as dense urban areas. This suggests that research should be directed at identifying any constraints and limitations of existing map matching algorithms as a prerequisite for the formulation of algorithm improvements. The objectives of this paper are thus to uncover the constraints and limitations by an in-depth literature review and to recommend ideas to address them. This paper also highlights the potential impacts of the forthcoming European Galileo system and the European Geostationary Overlay Service (EGNOS) on the performance of map matching algorithms. Although not addressed in detail, the paper also presents some ideas for monitoring the integrity of map-matching algorithms. The map-matching algorithms considered in this paper are generic and do not assume knowledge of {\^{a}}future{\^{a}} information (i.e. based on either cost or time). Clearly, such data would result in relatively simple map-matching algorithms. },

These new methods comply with the concepts and recommendations of the Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (GUM). In this paper, the authors introduce several alternatives for laboratories, notably those based on intra-laboratory and interlaboratory approaches. The intra-laboratory approaches will include the “modelling approach” (application of the procedure described in Chapter 8 of the GUM) and the “single-laboratory validation approach”. The interlaboratory approaches, based on collaborative studies, are the “interlaboratory validation approach” and the “proficiency testing approach”. The former uses the statistical methods described in ISO 5725 Accuracy (trueness and precision) of measurement methods and results, and the recent ISO Technical Specification 21748 Guidance for the use of repeatability, reproducibility and trueness estimates in uncertainty estimation. The second approach will certainly play an important role in the near future. Several testing laboratories are involved in proficiency testing scheme and are interested in the possibility of using the results of these exercises and the data accumulated over time to evaluate their uncertainty. The most important application area of these approaches certainly concerns medical laboratories. Recently, medical laboratories have been encouraged to evaluate their uncertainty of analysis, either by regulation or on a voluntary basis in the accreditation process. In this paper, the authors present the four methods, their coherence, and their common requirements: a clear definition of the measurand and a technical analysis of the measuring process to identify most of the uncertainty factors.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Smoothing splines have been used extensively in the analysis of gas concentration data from bubbles in ice cores. Since the fit is a linear projection of the data, propagation of data uncertainty through the fitting process is formally straightforward and, as we demonstrate, readily achievable from pre-existing spline-fitting procedures. The uncertainty propagation can be extended to determining both uncertainties in derivatives and uncertainties in quantities that reflect rates of input to the atmosphere. As an example, we apply the technique to 1000 yr of methane data from a Law Dome ice core.},

abstract = {The ability of providing an accurate view of a region of interest
is standard among existing tracking systems. Extending this capability
to work specifically with ground targets presents several interesting
challenges. In addition, the goal of our work is to examine the
performance at various times in the future. In order to provide this
precise representation of the area, we have employed a multiple
hypotheses tracking (MHT) algorithm. In this paper, we describe the
ground tracking problem and some of the issues that need to be
addressed. Furthermore, we give a brief description of the baseline MHT
approach and the enhancements to this approach that are required for
tracking ground targets. We conclude the paper with some preliminary
results},

abstract = {Vehicle tracking data is an essential “raw”ma- terial for a broad range of applications such as traffic management and control, routing, and navigation. An important issue with this data is its accuracy. The method of sampling vehicular movement using GPS is affected by two error sources and consequently produces inaccurate trajectory data. To become use- ful, the data has to be related to the under- lying road network by means of map match- ing algorithms. We present three such algo- rithms that consider especially the trajectory nature of the data rather than simply the cur- rent position as in the typical map-matching case. An incremental algorithm is proposed that matches consecutive portions of the tra- jectory to the road network, effectively trad- ing accuracy for speed of computation. In contrast, the two global algorithms compare the entire trajectory to candidate paths in the road network. The algorithms are evaluated in terms of (i) their running time and (ii) the quality of their matching result. Two novel qualitymeasures utilizing the Fr´ echet distance are introduced and subsequently used in an experimental evaluation to assess the quality of matching real tracking data to a road net- work. 1},

Graphs and Applications is based on a highly successful Open University course and the authors have paid particular attention to the presentation, clarity and arrangement of the material, making it ideally suited for independent study and classroom use. An important part of learning graph theory is problem solving; for this reason large numbers of examples, problems (with full solutions) and exercises (without solutions) are included. Accompanying the book is a CD-ROM comprising a Graphs Database, containing all the simple unlabelled graphs with up to seven vertices, and a Graphs Editor that enables students to construct and manipulate graphs. Both the Database and Editor are simple to use and allow students to investigate graphs with ease. Computing Notes and suggested activities are provided.},

abstract = {Step counting based dead-reckoning has been widely accepted as a cheap and effective solution for indoor pedestrian tracking using hand held device equipped with motion sensors. To calibrate the accumulating error in a dead-reckoning tracking system, extra techniques are always fused to form a hybrid system. Currently various particle filter based map filtering algorithms have been proposed in the literature. However, more improvement can be achieved by using map information. In this paper, a map matching involved step counting algorithm is proposed. It is shown that by applying map matching in an indoor environment with corridors, not only can the estimated location be calibrated, but also the estimated sensor's orientation and the walking direction, which reduces the error in the ensuing location update process. The computational complexity is also less than the particle filter. Experimental results show that map matching algorithm returns more accurate results than the particle filter given the same map information. Further experiments indicate that when incomplete map information is given, the particle filter is much easier in returning a drifted path compared to map matching. This indicates that less map information is required by map matching to achieve a robust performance. This reduced reliance on accurate map information implies less labour cost and error in map maintenance.},

@misc{Agate2003,
abstract = {Sequential Monte Carlo methods have attracted the attention of the tracking community as a solution to Bayesian estimation particularly for nonlinear problems. Several attributes of particle filters support their use in jointly tracking and identifying ground targets in a road-constrained network. First, since the target dynamics are simulated, propagating a target within a constrained state space is handled quite naturally since the particle filter is not restricted to propagating Gaussian PDFs. Furthermore, a particle filter can approximate a PDF which is a mixture of continuous random variables (the target kinematic state) and discrete random variables (the target ID) which is necessary for the joint tracking and identification problem. Given HRRGMTI measurements of a target, we propose to jointly estimate a target's kinematic state and identification by propagating the joint PDF of the target kinematic state (position and velocity) and target ID. In this way, we capitalize on the inherent coupling between the target's feature measurement (the HRR profile) and the target's kinematic state. In addition to the coupling between a target's feature measurement and the target's kinematic state, there exists a coupling between a target's dynamics and the target's ID which can also be exploited through particle filtering methods. We develop the particle filtering algorithm for tracking and identifying ground targets in a road-constrained environment and present simulation results for a two-class problem.},
